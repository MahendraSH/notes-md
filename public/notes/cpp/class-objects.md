# Learn how to define classes, including constructors, destructors, access specifiers (public, private, protected), and member functions.

Certainly! Let's cover how to define classes in C++, including constructors, destructors, access specifiers, and member functions:

1. **Class Definition**:

   - In C++, a class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and optional base classes.
   - The class body is enclosed within curly braces `{}`.

   ```cpp
   // Example class definition
   class MyClass {
       // Class members declaration
   };
   ```

2. **Access Specifiers**:

   - C++ provides three access specifiers: `public`, `private`, and `protected`.
   - These specifiers control the accessibility of class members.
     - `public`: Members are accessible from outside the class.
     - `private`: Members are accessible only within the class.
     - `protected`: Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes.

   ```cpp
   class MyClass {
   public:
       int publicVar;    // Public member variable
       void publicFunc();  // Public member function

   private:
       int privateVar;   // Private member variable
       void privateFunc(); // Private member function

   protected:
       int protectedVar;  // Protected member variable
       void protectedFunc();  // Protected member function
   };
   ```

3. **Constructors**:

   - Constructors are special member functions used to initialize objects of a class.
   - They have the same name as the class and are invoked automatically when an object is created.
   - Constructors can be overloaded to provide multiple initialization options.

   ```cpp
   class MyClass {
   public:
       // Default constructor
       MyClass() {
           // Initialization code
       }

       // Parameterized constructor
       MyClass(int val) {
           // Initialization code with parameter
       }
   };
   ```

4. **Destructors**:

   - Destructors are special member functions used to clean up resources when an object is destroyed.
   - They have the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (`~`).
   - Destructors are invoked automatically when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

   ```cpp
   class MyClass {
   public:
       // Constructor
       MyClass() {
           // Initialization code
       }

       // Destructor
       ~MyClass() {
           // Cleanup code
       }
   };
   ```

5. **Member Functions**:

   - Member functions are functions defined within a class that operate on the class's data members.
   - They can be declared and defined within the class declaration or separately outside the class.
   - Member functions can access the class's private data members.

   ```cpp
   class MyClass {
   private:
       int data;

   public:
       // Member function declaration
       void setData(int val);

       // Member function definition
       int getData() const {
           return data;
       }
   };

   // Member function definition outside the class
   void MyClass::setData(int val) {
       data = val;
   }
   ```

By understanding how to define classes, including constructors, destructors, access specifiers, and member functions, you can create well-structured and modular C++ code. These features provide powerful tools for encapsulating data, controlling access, and defining behavior within your programs.

# Understand object instantiation, initialization, and memory allocation.

Certainly! Let's explore object instantiation, initialization, and memory allocation in the context of C++:

1. **Object Instantiation**:

   - **Definition**: Object instantiation refers to the creation of an instance of a class, also known as an object.
   - **Process**: When an object is instantiated, memory is allocated to hold the object's data members, and its constructor is called to initialize those members.
   - **Syntax**: Object instantiation in C++ involves declaring a variable of the class type using the class name followed by parentheses `()`.

   ```cpp
   // Class definition
   class MyClass {
   public:
       // Constructor
       MyClass() {
           // Initialization code
       }
   };

   int main() {
       // Object instantiation
       MyClass obj; // Instantiates an object of class MyClass
       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Object Initialization**:

   - **Definition**: Object initialization involves initializing the data members of an object either during its declaration or through constructor parameters.
   - **Process**: Data members can be initialized using initializer lists in the constructor definition or through constructor parameters passed during object instantiation.
   - **Syntax**:

   ```cpp
   class MyClass {
   private:
       int value;
   public:
       // Constructor with initialization through initializer list
       MyClass(int val) : value(val) {
           // Initialization code
       }
   };

   int main() {
       // Object initialization during instantiation
       MyClass obj1(10); // Initializes value to 10 during object creation
       MyClass obj2 = MyClass(20); // Alternate syntax for object initialization
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. **Memory Allocation**:

   - **Definition**: Memory allocation refers to the process of reserving memory space for an object's data members in the computer's memory.
   - **Process**: When an object is instantiated, memory is allocated dynamically or statically based on the object's size and lifetime.
   - **Static Allocation**: Memory is allocated at compile time when the object is declared as a local variable or global variable.
   - **Dynamic Allocation**: Memory is allocated at runtime using the `new` keyword for objects with dynamic lifetimes. It must be manually deallocated using the `delete` keyword to prevent memory leaks.

   ```cpp
   int main() {
       // Static memory allocation
       MyClass obj1; // Memory is allocated on the stack

       // Dynamic memory allocation
       MyClass* obj2 = new MyClass(); // Memory is allocated on the heap

       // Deallocate dynamically allocated memory
       delete obj2;

       return 0;
   }
   ```

Object instantiation, initialization, and memory allocation are crucial concepts in C++ programming, ensuring that objects are created, initialized, and stored appropriately in memory. By understanding these concepts, you can effectively manage object lifetimes and prevent memory-related issues in your programs.

# Practice creating class hierarchies and implementing inheritance.

Certainly! Let's practice creating class hierarchies and implementing inheritance in C++. We'll create a simple example of a class hierarchy representing different types of vehicles:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Base class representing a vehicle
class Vehicle {
protected:
    int speed;

public:
    // Constructor
    Vehicle(int s) : speed(s) {}

    // Virtual function to get vehicle info
    virtual void getInfo() const {
        std::cout << "Vehicle - Speed: " << speed << " km/h" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class representing a car
class Car : public Vehicle {
private:
    std::string brand;

public:
    // Constructor
    Car(int s, const std::string& b) : Vehicle(s), brand(b) {}

    // Overridden function to get car info
    void getInfo() const override {
        std::cout << "Car - Brand: " << brand << ", Speed: " << speed << " km/h" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Derived class representing a bicycle
class Bicycle : public Vehicle {
private:
    int numGears;

public:
    // Constructor
    Bicycle(int s, int gears) : Vehicle(s), numGears(gears) {}

    // Overridden function to get bicycle info
    void getInfo() const override {
        std::cout << "Bicycle - Gears: " << numGears << ", Speed: " << speed << " km/h" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create objects of different classes
    Vehicle* v1 = new Vehicle(60);
    Car* c1 = new Car(120, "Toyota");
    Bicycle* b1 = new Bicycle(20, 6);

    // Call member function through pointers
    v1->getInfo();  // Output: Vehicle - Speed: 60 km/h
    c1->getInfo();  // Output: Car - Brand: Toyota, Speed: 120 km/h
    b1->getInfo();  // Output: Bicycle - Gears: 6, Speed: 20 km/h

    // Delete dynamically allocated objects
    delete v1;
    delete c1;
    delete b1;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example:

- We have a base class `Vehicle` with a member variable `speed` and a virtual function `getInfo()` to display vehicle information.
- We have two derived classes `Car` and `Bicycle`, each inheriting from the `Vehicle` class.
- Each derived class has its own member variables (`brand` for `Car` and `numGears` for `Bicycle`) and overrides the `getInfo()` function to provide specific information.
- In the `main()` function, we create objects of different classes and call the `getInfo()` function through pointers to the base class.
- Polymorphism ensures that the appropriate version of the `getInfo()` function is called based on the actual type of the object.

This example demonstrates how to create class hierarchies and use inheritance in C++. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!
