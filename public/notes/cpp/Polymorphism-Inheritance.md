# Study how polymorphism is achieved through function overloading and overriding.

Certainly! Polymorphism in C++ is achieved through two main mechanisms: function overloading and function overriding. Let's delve into each of these concepts:

1. **Function Overloading**:

   - **Definition**: Function overloading refers to the ability to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists within the same scope.
   - **Process**: When a function is overloaded, the compiler distinguishes between the overloaded functions based on the number and types of parameters passed to them.
   - **Example**:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   // Function overloading
   void print(int num) {
       std::cout << "Integer: " << num << std::endl;
   }

   void print(double num) {
       std::cout << "Double: " << num << std::endl;
   }

   int main() {
       print(10);     // Output: Integer: 10
       print(3.14);   // Output: Double: 3.14
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `print()` function is overloaded with two versions: one that takes an integer parameter and another that takes a double parameter. The appropriate version of the function is called based on the type of the argument passed.

2. **Function Overriding**:

   - **Definition**: Function overriding occurs when a derived class provides a specific implementation for a function that is already defined in its base class.
   - **Process**: The overridden function in the derived class has the same name, return type, and parameter list as the function in the base class. The `override` keyword is used to indicate that a function is intended to override a virtual function from the base class.
   - **Example**:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   // Base class
   class Base {
   public:
       // Virtual function
       virtual void display() const {
           std::cout << "Base display() called" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   // Derived class
   class Derived : public Base {
   public:
       // Override the base class function
       void display() const override {
           std::cout << "Derived display() called" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Base* ptr = new Derived(); // Base class pointer pointing to derived class object
       ptr->display(); // Output: Derived display() called
       delete ptr;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `Base` class has a virtual function `display()`. The `Derived` class overrides this function with its own implementation. When a `Derived` object is accessed through a pointer to its base class, the overridden function in the derived class is called, demonstrating runtime polymorphism.

Function overloading and function overriding are essential concepts in achieving polymorphism in C++. They provide flexibility and extensibility in designing and implementing object-oriented systems. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!

# Learn about virtual functions and pure virtual functions

Certainly! Let's delve into virtual functions and pure virtual functions in C++:

1. **Virtual Functions**:

   - **Definition**: A virtual function is a member function declared within a base class that can be overridden in derived classes. It enables dynamic polymorphism, allowing the correct function to be called based on the type of the object being pointed to or referenced.
   - **Process**: To declare a function as virtual, use the `virtual` keyword in the base class's function declaration. Derived classes can then override the virtual function using the `override` keyword.
   - **Example**:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   // Base class
   class Base {
   public:
       // Virtual function
       virtual void display() const {
           std::cout << "Base display() called" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   // Derived class
   class Derived : public Base {
   public:
       // Override the base class function
       void display() const override {
           std::cout << "Derived display() called" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Base* ptr = new Derived(); // Base class pointer pointing to derived class object
       ptr->display(); // Output: Derived display() called
       delete ptr;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `Base` class has a virtual function `display()`, which is overridden in the `Derived` class. When a `Derived` object is accessed through a pointer to its base class, the overridden function in the derived class is called, demonstrating runtime polymorphism.

2. **Pure Virtual Functions**:

   - **Definition**: A pure virtual function is a virtual function declared in a base class with no implementation provided. It serves as a placeholder for functions that must be overridden by derived classes.
   - **Process**: To declare a function as pure virtual, use the syntax `virtual returnType functionName() = 0;`. Classes containing pure virtual functions are called abstract base classes, and they cannot be instantiated.
   - **Example**:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   // Abstract base class
   class Shape {
   public:
       // Pure virtual function
       virtual double area() const = 0;
   };

   // Derived class 1: Rectangle
   class Rectangle : public Shape {
   private:
       double length;
       double width;

   public:
       Rectangle(double l, double w) : length(l), width(w) {}

       // Override the pure virtual function
       double area() const override {
           return length * width;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       // Shape* ptr = new Shape(); // Error: Cannot instantiate abstract class
       Shape* ptr = new Rectangle(5, 10); // OK
       std::cout << "Area: " << ptr->area() << std::endl; // Output: Area: 50
       delete ptr;
       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `Shape` class is an abstract base class with a pure virtual function `area()`. The `Rectangle` class inherits from `Shape` and overrides the `area()` function with its implementation. Since `Shape` is an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated, but derived classes like `Rectangle` can.

Virtual functions and pure virtual functions play a crucial role in achieving runtime polymorphism and enabling the design of abstract classes and interfaces in C++. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!

# Understand the concepts of dynamic binding and static binding.

Dynamic binding and static binding are two important concepts in object-oriented programming, particularly in languages like C++:

1. **Static Binding**:

   - **Definition**: Static binding, also known as early binding or compile-time binding, occurs when the method to be executed is determined at compile time based on the type of the object reference or pointer.
   - **Process**: In static binding, the compiler knows exactly which function to call at compile time, based on the declared type of the object reference or pointer.
   - **Example**:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   // Base class
   class Base {
   public:
       void display() {
           std::cout << "Base display() called" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   // Derived class
   class Derived : public Base {
   public:
       void display() {
           std::cout << "Derived display() called" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Base baseObj;
       Derived derivedObj;

       Base* ptr1 = &baseObj;
       Base* ptr2 = &derivedObj;

       ptr1->display(); // Output: Base display() called
       ptr2->display(); // Output: Base display() called

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In this example, `ptr1` and `ptr2` are both pointers of type `Base*`. When calling the `display()` function through these pointers, the compiler binds the function call to the `Base::display()` function at compile time, regardless of the actual type of the object being pointed to.

2. **Dynamic Binding**:

   - **Definition**: Dynamic binding, also known as late binding or runtime binding, occurs when the method to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.
   - **Process**: In dynamic binding, the decision on which function to call is postponed until runtime. This allows for polymorphic behavior, where different functions can be called based on the type of the object.
   - **Example**:

   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>

   // Base class
   class Base {
   public:
       virtual void display() {
           std::cout << "Base display() called" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   // Derived class
   class Derived : public Base {
   public:
       void display() override {
           std::cout << "Derived display() called" << std::endl;
       }
   };

   int main() {
       Base baseObj;
       Derived derivedObj;

       Base* ptr1 = &baseObj;
       Base* ptr2 = &derivedObj;

       ptr1->display(); // Output: Base display() called
       ptr2->display(); // Output: Derived display() called

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   In this example, the `display()` function in the `Base` class is declared as `virtual`, indicating that it can be overridden by derived classes. When calling the `display()` function through pointers `ptr1` and `ptr2`, the function call is dynamically bound at runtime based on the actual type of the object being pointed to. As a result, the correct overridden function (`Derived::display()`) is called for the `ptr2` object.

In summary, static binding occurs at compile time and is based on the declared type of the object reference or pointer, while dynamic binding occurs at runtime and is based on the actual type of the object. Dynamic binding enables polymorphism and allows for more flexible and extensible code. If you have any further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!
