# Package diagram

- Provides clarity and understanding in a complex systems development
- Supports concurrent model use by multiple users
- Supports version control
- Provides abstraction at multiple levelsâ€”from systems to classes in a
  component
- Provides encapsulation and containment; supports modularity

## The essential elements of a package diagram are packages, their visibility, and their dependencies.

## Essentials: The Package Notatio

- ## The Package Notation for Contained Element

## Essentials: Visibility of Elements

- Public (+) Visible to elements within its containing package, including
  nested packages, and to external elements
- Private (-) Visible only to elements within its containing package and to
  nested package

# Component Diagrams

## The essential elements of a component diagram are components, their interfaces, and their realizations

## provider( ball ) and require (socket )

- the ball-and-socket notation is used to specify the required and
  provided interfaces of each of the components. The interfaces between the components are called assembly connectors; they are also known as interface connectors. Though the assembly connectors are shown in the ball-and-socket notation

# deployment diagram

# # The three essential elements of a deployment diagram are artifacts, nodes, and their connections

##  The Artifact Notatio
it can use `<< (uses , manifestes ---------------->) ,( relatises---------|> )   >>`
