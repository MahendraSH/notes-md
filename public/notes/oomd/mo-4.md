**Process**

- Step by step execution of an activity in a system
- Should be defined first and  then refined through out the development lifecycle
- A well established process for software development leads to a successful project
- Successful project characteristics:
- Existence of a strong architectural vision
- Application of a well-managed iterative and incremental development life cycle 

**Good Software Architecture**

- Attributes:
- *It is constructed using well-defined layers of abstraction*
- *There is a clear separation of concerns between  the interface and the implementation of each layer*
- *The architecture is simple â€“ common behaviour achieved through common abstraction and common mechanisms*

**Iterative and Incremental  life cycle**

- This type of development happens when the functionality of the system is developed, delivered in the successive series of releases (iteration) of increasing completeness (incremental)
- This approach is at the heart of most modern software developemnt methods such as agile methods including XP, SCRUM
- Extremely well suited to the OO paradigm
- Offers benefits to risk management

**Advantages - Iterative development approach**

1. Requirements changes are accommodated  
1. Integration is progressive and continual
1. Ricks are addressed early in the life cycle
1. Tactical changes to the product are possible
1. Reuse is facilitated
1. Testing is performed during every iteration, so that defects can be found out early
1. Team members learn along every iteration and out of practice
1. Development process can be refined and improved in every iteration
- Agile process
- Is a software development process, the focus is to deliver a system to the customer that meets their current needs in short span of time      
- Plan-driven process
- Is a software development process, the focus is to deliver  a desired  system  to  the customer in an acceptable time frame along with its artefacts' as key results

**Process characteristics**

- Agile Process ![ref1]
1. Light weight and sparse, less ceremony
1. Reliant on tacit knowledge of team members
1. Tactically focused 
1. Heavily reliant on customer collaboration 
1. Self-organizing and managing 
- Plan-driven Process
1. More heavy weight, more ![ref1]ceremony
1. Reliant on  the well documented processes
1. Strategically focused
1. Reliant on customer contact
1. Managed and controlled

**Project characteristics**

- Agile Project  â€¢ Plan-driven Project![](https://notes-mds.vercel.app/notes/oomd/Aspose.Words.49fa3a22-7eb7-4a23-9c13-fe3949e71c04.002.png)![](https://notes-mds.vercel.app/notes/oomd/Aspose.Words.49fa3a22-7eb7-4a23-9c13-fe3949e71c04.003.png)
1. Project size is small (5-10  1. Project size is large (> 10 people) people)
1. Experienced teams with a  2. Team includes various wide range of abilities and  capabilities and skill sets skill set 3. Teams are geographically 
1. Teams are self-starters,  distributed and/or independent leaders outsourced  
1. Project is in-house and scope  4. Project is of strategic  within  organization  importance, scope crosses 
1. System is new and lot of  the organization unknowns 5. System is understood with 
1. Requirements are volatile  familiar scope and features

6\. Requirements are fairly stable

**Macro process development framework**

- Is the overall software development life cycle that serves as the controlling framework for the micro process
- Purpose is to guide the overall development of the system, leading to the production of system
- Starts  from  identification  of  an  idea  to  its implementation in the first version, in the subsequent versions, the system is evolved and maintained 
- Described in terms of 2 dimensions: 
1. **Content** - includes roles, tasks, work products described in terms of disciplines or areas
1. **Time** â€“ described in terms of mile stones, phases and iterations

**Macro process Content Dimension - Disciplines**

- Requirements Ã  Analysis and designÃ  Implementation Ã  Test Ã  Deployment
- are  executed in relative order and in iterative manner 
- Project management, configuration and change management, Environment 
- are executed throughout the life cycle 

**Macro process  Time Dimension**

- Described in terms of mile stones, phases and iterations
- Phases
1. Inception
1. Elaboration
1. Construction
1. Transition

**The micro process- analysis and design**

- The macro process drives the scope of the micro process â€“ provides inputs to the micro process, takes outputs of the micro process
- It takes the requirements provided by the macro process and produce design specifications that are implemented, tested and deployed in the macro process
- The micro process is described in terms of  two  dimensions: 
- Levels of abstraction and content (activities and work products)

**Key activities**

1. Identify elements![](https://notes-mds.vercel.app/notes/oomd/Aspose.Words.49fa3a22-7eb7-4a23-9c13-fe3949e71c04.007.png)![](https://notes-mds.vercel.app/notes/oomd/Aspose.Words.49fa3a22-7eb7-4a23-9c13-fe3949e71c04.008.png)
1. Define element collaborations
1. Define element relationships
1. Define element               semantics

**Work products**

1. The architectural description
1. The analysis and design  model

**Pragmatics**

1. Management and planning 
- Risk management
- Technical and non technical risks
- Task planning 
- Involves scheduling the deliverables of the macro process
- Team meetings
- Development reviews
- Formal reviews
- Architectural reviews
- Informal reviews
2. Staffing
- Resource allocation
- Development team roles â€“ Project architect, Component lead, Application engineer
3. Release management 
   1. Configuration management  and  version control
   1. Integration, Testing
3. Reuse 
- Use case scenarios, design, code, classes, patterns, documentation 
5. Quality assurance and metrics â€“ OO metrics, process and product metrics
5. Documentation

**Benefits of OO development**

- Encourages reuse of software components
- Reduces development risks
- Exploits expressive power of OO programming languages
- The object model forms the conceptual framework for notation and processes of OO development
- Helps to construct well-structured complex systems with hierarchy, abstractions, separation of concern, patterns and stable intermediate forms

**Risks of OO development** 

- Personnel shortfalls
- Unrealistic schedules, budgets or processes
- Short-fall in commercial off-the shelf products, external components or legacy software
- Mismatch in requirements 
- Short fall in architecture, performance and quality
