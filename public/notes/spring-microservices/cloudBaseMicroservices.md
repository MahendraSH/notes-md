  - cloud based microservices is a distributed computing platform that provides a set of services and infrastructure for building and running applications.
- **Cloud enabled** and **Cloud native microservices**
  - Cloud enabled and Cloud native microservices are microservices that are built and run in a cloud environment.
  - just deploying microservices in a cloud environment is called cloud enabled microservices.
  - cloud native microservices are microservices that are built and run in a cloud environment and are designed to be easy to manage and scale.
- **Cloud native microservices advantages**:
  - elasticity , load balance , resilience , security
  - cloud native microservices are easy to manage and scale.
  - cloud native microservices are secure.
  - cloud native microservices are cost-effective.
  - cloud native microservices are easy to migrate and upgrade.
- **challenges of cloud native microservices**:
  - discovery of services is complex.
  - distributed configuration management is complex.
  - load balancing is complex.
  - reliability is complex.
  - monitoring and tracing is complex.
- **The challenges of cloud native microservices can be solved by using Spring Cloud , Netflix oss etc .**
- **The Spring Cloud project consists of the following component**:

  - Spring Cloud Config
  - Spring Cloud Consul
  - Spring Cloud Gateway
  - Spring Cloud Load Balancer
  - Spring Cloud Stream
  - Spring Cloud Bus
  - Spring Cloud Security
  - Spring Cloud Service Registry etc .
