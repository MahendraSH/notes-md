# Computer Vision in Agricultural Engineering:

# Toxins in Agriculture products, (Aflatoxin),

- `aflatoxins` are `Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus`, which are abundant in warm and `humid` regions of the world.
- problems in human and animals
  - hepatotoxicity
  - teratogenicity
  - immunotoxicity
- types
  - B1 and B2
  - G1 and G2

# Methods of detection of toxins,

- using uv radiation
  - B1 and B2 (blue) 425nm
  - G1 and G2 (green) 540nm
- Thin layer chromatography (TLC )
- Hight performace liquid chromatography (HPLC )
- biosensors and immunoassays

# Detection of Aflatoxin in Agricultural products by Deep Learning

Deep Learning (DL), particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is applied for efficient toxin detection.

Pixel-level aflatoxin detecting based on deep learning and hyperspectral
imaging

Example :

- Aflatoxin in peanut 146 images of peanut where taken using SCOMS camera 73 images before and after contamination

- then using CNN ( Convolutional neural network ) method a Deep leaning model is created

results :

1. 95 % accurate in pixel-levl
2. 90% accurate in kernel level
