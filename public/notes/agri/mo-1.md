# what is farming

# what is cropping?

farming -> balance (ecological and social , economic)

- Irrigated farming system, embracing a broad range of food and crop production.
- Wetland rice-based farming system, dependent upon seasonal rains supplemented by
  irrigation.
- Rainfed farming system in humid areas: It is characterized by specific dominant crops
  or mixed crop-livestock system.
- Rainfed farming system in steep and highland areas: They are often mixed crop livestock system.
- Dualistic (mixed large commercial and little holders) farming system, across a spread
  of ecologies and with diverse production patterns.
- Rainfed farming system in dry or cold low potential areas: It consist of crop-livestock
  and pastoral syst

**SLE: Water Management of Principal Crops in India:**
Water management is critical for crop production in India, given the diverse climatic conditions. Efficient water use, irrigation scheduling, and water conservation practices are essential for sustaining principal crops like rice, wheat, sugarcane, and cotton.

In conclusion, an in-depth understanding of various aspects of agriculture, from soil-plant-water relationships to crop management practices, is essential for sustainable and productive farming systems. Water management, in particular, is a crucial aspect that needs careful attention to ensure the sustainability of agriculture in a water-scarce world.
