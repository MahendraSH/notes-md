# selection criteria for sensors

1. _Accuracy_ : precise and reliable measurements
2. _Durability_: harsh environment and weather condtions `(durable engough)`
3. _Ease of use_: framers do not know how to read , so easy to install and use
4. _Compatibility_ : compatible with existing system
5. _Cost_: low cost `(tight budgets)` and must be worth the value
6. _Battery life_: long Battery life
7. _Connectivity and data managment_ : must send `data to cpu` for analysis and decision , must support` wired and wireless`
8. _Appropriateness_: the senosors must be choosen according to crop and usecase

# pH sensor, moisture sensor, humidity sensor,

### 1. pH Sensor:

- _Purpose:_ Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the soil.
- _Application:_ Guides farmers in adjusting soil pH for optimal crop growth.
- _Technology:_ Electrochemical sensors are commonly used for pH measurements.

### 2. Moisture Sensor:

- _Purpose:_ Measures the moisture content in the soil.
- _Application:_ Aids in irrigation management, preventing overwatering or underwatering.
- _Technologies:_ Capacitance-based or resistance-based sensors are often employed.

### 3. Humidity Sensor:

- _Purpose:_ Measures the moisture content in the air.
- _Application:_ Helps in understanding atmospheric conditions affecting crops.
- _Types:_ Resistive, capacitive, or thermal conductivity sensors are commonly used.

# Measurement of soil nutrients (NPK)

- using senors
- soil fertility
- nutritional deficiency or abundance
- High-quality `probe` of sensor , rust resistance , salt and alkali corrosion resistance, electrolytic resistance `(as it buried in soil)`

- (NPK)- healthy grouth of plant

## methods of measure NPK level

1. _soil testing_ : soil samples are given to lab
2. _Nutrient extractoin method_ - using `chemical solution` and `spectrophotometry` and other various techniques
3. _plant tissue analysis_ : NPK in plant tissue like leaft , is measure which intern gives NPK level in soil
4. _Field kits_ : on site measurement , color based chemical reagents , no so precise / correct

# Need for signal conditioning

- Signal conditioning in agriculture refers to the process of `manipulating and preparing input signals` from sensors and other agricultural instruments for better `reliability` and `accuracy` of measurements.

## reasons for signal conditioning

1. _Improve accuracy_ : by fillter out unwanted `noice` and `disturbance` , help in `good decision making `
2. _Improve reliability_ : improving reliability , help to operate in desired range , r`educes instuction failure`
3. _Compatibility_: helps to connect diffent agri instruments which require` diffent signals`
4. _Data integration_: helps in integrating of` data from various place` and to where the improvment must be done
5. _Cost-effectiveness_: `poor signal` leads to wastage of resources and lost of harvest , but this gives good harvest

### **SLE: Spatial Data Creation and Editing in GIS**

**Spatial Data Creation:**

- In GIS, spatial data is created through the collection of geographical information, either through surveys, satellite imagery, or GPS data.
- This data includes information about the location, shape, and characteristics of geographic features.

**Spatial Data Editing:**

- Editing in GIS involves modifying or updating spatial data to reflect changes in the real world.
- Techniques include adding new features, deleting obsolete ones, or adjusting attributes.

Spatial data creation and editing are fundamental to maintaining accurate and up-to-date geographic information, which is crucial for effective decision-making in precision agriculture and other fields that rely on spatial data analysis.
