### **SLE: Spatial Data Creation and Editing in GIS**

**Spatial Data Creation:**

- In GIS, spatial data is created through the collection of geographical information, either through surveys, satellite imagery, or GPS data.
- This data includes information about the location, shape, and characteristics of geographic features.

**Spatial Data Editing:**

- Editing in GIS involves modifying or updating spatial data to reflect changes in the real world.
- Techniques include adding new features, deleting obsolete ones, or adjusting attributes.

Spatial data creation and editing are fundamental to maintaining accurate and up-to-date geographic information, which is crucial for effective decision-making in precision agriculture and other fields that rely on spatial data analysis.
