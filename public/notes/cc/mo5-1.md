Here is some information about SOA properties, REST principles, and REST architectural elements:

- **SOA**: Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a software design and architectural pattern that defines how to design a software system that makes use of services of new or legacy applications through their published or discoverable interfaces. SOA also aims to make service interoperability extensible and effective. It prompts architecture styles such as loose coupling, published interfaces, and a standard communication model in order to support this goal¹.
- **REST**: Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. RESTful web services provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. RESTful web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations².
- **REST architectural elements**: REST architectural elements include resources, representations, messages, and connectors¹. Resources are the key abstraction of information in REST. Each resource is identified by a unique identifier, which is used to reference the resource in the system. Representations are the format in which resources are exchanged between clients and servers. Messages are the way that clients and servers communicate with each other. Connectors are the means by which clients and servers communicate with each other¹.
