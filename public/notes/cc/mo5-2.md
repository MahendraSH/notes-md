The selected text is part of a book chapter that introduces the concept of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and its properties. Here is a summary of the main points:

- **SOA**: A design approach for building software systems that use services of new or legacy applications through their published or discoverable interfaces. Services are logical abstractions of actual programs, databases, business processes, etc. that perform business-level operations.
- **Message orientation**: The key feature of SOA that hides the internal structure and implementation details of service providers and requesters. Services communicate only through messages that conform to a standard format and protocol.
- **REST**: Representational State Transfer, a set of architectural principles for designing web services that adhere to the constraints of the web. RESTful web services are stateless, uniform, cacheable, and scalable.
- **REST principles**: The main principles of REST are:
  - Resource identification: Every resource (such as a document, an image, a service, etc.) is identified by a unique and global identifier, such as a URI.
  - Resource manipulation: Resources can be manipulated by using a uniform set of methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, that correspond to the CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete).
  - Self-descriptive messages: Messages exchanged between clients and servers contain all the information needed to understand and process them, such as the content type, the content length, the cache control, etc.
  - Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS): Clients can discover and navigate resources by following hyperlinks embedded in the representations of resources, rather than relying on predefined interfaces or out-of-band information.
- **REST architectural elements**: The main elements of REST are:
  - Resource: An abstraction of a piece of information or a service that can be identified, named, addressed, or handled.
  - Representation: A concrete format and data structure that conveys the state of a resource at a given point in time. A resource can have multiple representations, such as XML, JSON, HTML, etc.
  - Connector: A component that mediates the communication between clients and servers, such as a client library, a proxy, a gateway, etc.
  - Component: A software module that implements the application logic and provides or consumes resources, such as a web browser, a web server, a web service, etc.
- **Core technologies of today's web service**: The main technologies that enable the development and deployment of web services are:
  - XML: Extensible Markup Language, a standard syntax for defining structured data that can be exchanged and processed across different platforms and applications.
  - SOAP: Simple Object Access Protocol, a protocol for exchanging structured and typed information between web service providers and requesters, using XML as the message format and HTTP as the transport protocol.
  - WSDL: Web Services Description Language, a language for describing the interface, functionality, and location of web services, using XML as the syntax.
  - UDDI: Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration, a registry service that allows web service providers to publish their services and web service requesters to discover and bind to them.
