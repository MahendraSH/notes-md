The selected text is part of a book chapter that introduces the concept of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and its properties. Here is a summary of the main points:

- **SOA**: A design approach for building software systems that use services of new or legacy applications through their published or discoverable interfaces. Services are logical abstractions of actual programs, databases, business processes, etc. that perform business-level operations.
- **Message orientation**: The key feature of SOA that hides the internal structure and implementation details of service providers and requesters. Services communicate only through messages that conform to a standard format and protocol.
- **REST**: Representational State Transfer, a set of architectural principles for designing web services that adhere to the constraints of the web. RESTful web services are stateless, uniform, cacheable, and scalable.
