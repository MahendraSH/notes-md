Sure! Here are brief answers to the 100 questions on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++ and Java:

1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

   - OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. It emphasizes modular design, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **Explain the four fundamental principles of OOP.**

   - The four fundamental principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation bundles data and methods into a single unit. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from another class. Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Abstraction hides complex implementation details behind simpler interfaces.

3. **What is a class?**

   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects in OOP. It defines the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.

4. **What is an object?**

   - An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and encapsulates data and methods to manipulate that data.

5. **What is inheritance?**

   - Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP where a new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class).

6. **Explain the types of inheritance in C++ and Java.**

   - In C++ and Java, inheritance can be single inheritance (a subclass inherits from only one superclass), multiple inheritance (a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses), or hierarchical inheritance (multiple subclasses inherit from the same superclass).

7. **What is encapsulation?**

   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of an object and only exposes necessary interfaces for interaction.

8. **How does encapsulation enhance security and maintainability?**

   - Encapsulation enhances security by preventing direct access to an object's internal state and allowing controlled access through methods. It improves maintainability by localizing changes to the internal implementation of a class.

9. **What is abstraction?**

   - Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features of an object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it achieves it.

10. **Provide an example of abstraction in C++ and Java.**

    - In C++, an example of abstraction is a class representing a car with methods like `start()` and `stop()`, hiding the internal details of the engine.
    - In Java, an example of abstraction is an interface defining methods like `play()` and `pause()` for a multimedia player, without specifying how each media type is handled.

11. **What is polymorphism?**

    - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to behave differently based on the object they are called on.

12. **Explain the difference between compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.**

    - Compile-time polymorphism (also known as static polymorphism) is achieved through method overloading and function templates, where the decision of which method or function to call is made at compile time. Runtime polymorphism (also known as dynamic polymorphism) is achieved through method overriding and virtual functions, where the decision of which method to call is made at runtime based on the type of the object.

13. **How are constructors and destructors different in C++ and Java?**

    - In C++, constructors and destructors are special member functions of a class used to initialize and destroy objects, respectively. In Java, constructors serve the same purpose, but Java does not have explicit destructors; instead, it relies on automatic garbage collection to reclaim memory when objects are no longer needed.

14. **What is method overriding?**

    - Method overriding is a feature of OOP that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It enables polymorphism and dynamic binding.

15. **What is method overloading?**

    - Method overloading is a feature of OOP that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. It enables compile-time polymorphism.

16. **Provide an example of method overloading in C++ and Java.**

    - In C++, an example of method overloading is having multiple `print()` methods in a class that accept different types of parameters (int, double, string).
    - In Java, an example of method overloading is having multiple `calculate()` methods in a class that perform different arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) with different parameter types (int, double).

17. **What is a static method?**

    - A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than to any specific instance of the class. It can be called without creating an instance of the class and can access static members of the class.

18. **How do you access static members in C++ and Java?**

    - In C++, static members are accessed using the scope resolution operator (::) or through object instances. In Java, static members are accessed using the class name followed by the dot operator.

19. **What is a virtual function?**

    - A virtual function is a member function in a base class that is declared with the `virtual` keyword and can be overridden in derived classes. It enables dynamic binding and runtime polymorphism.

20. **Explain the concept of dynamic binding.**

    - Dynamic binding (also known as late binding or runtime polymorphism) is the process of determining which implementation of a method to call at runtime based on the type of the object the method is called on. It allows for polymorphic behavior.

21. **How do you achieve runtime polymorphism in C++ and Java?**

    - In C++, runtime polymorphism is achieved through virtual functions and inheritance. In Java, it is achieved through method overriding and the `@Override` annotation.

22. **What is a pure virtual function?**

    - A pure virtual function is a virtual function in a base class that has no implementation and is meant to be overridden by derived classes. Classes containing pure virtual functions are called abstract classes and cannot be instantiated.

23. **Explain the use of abstract classes in C++ and Java.**

    - Abstract classes in C++ and Java are classes that contain one or more pure virtual functions. They cannot be instantiated and are meant to serve as base classes for other classes to inherit from and provide concrete implementations for the pure virtual functions.

24. **What is a concrete class?**

    - A concrete class is a class that provides implementations for all its member functions, including any inherited virtual functions. It can be instantiated and used to create objects.

25. **What is a friend function in C++?**

    - A friend function in C++ is a function that is not a member of a class but has access to the private and protected members of the class when declared as a friend in the class declaration.

26. **How does friend function differ from a member function?**

    - A friend function is not a member of a class but has access to its private and protected members when declared as a friend in the class declaration. In contrast, a member function is a function that is part of a class and has access to its private and protected members directly.

27. **What is a friend class in C++?**

    - A friend class in C++ is a class that is granted access to the private and protected members of another class when declared as a friend in the class declaration. All member functions of a friend class have access to the private and protected members of the class it is a friend of.

28. **How do you implement friend functions and friend classes in Java?**

    - Java does not have the concept of friend functions or friend classes like C++. Instead, access to private members of a class is controlled through methods provided by the class itself or through access modifiers such as `public`, `private`, and `protected`.

29. **Explain the concept of data hiding.**

    - Data hiding is the principle of restricting access to certain components of an object, such as its data members or internal implementation details, to prevent direct manipulation and ensure proper encapsulation. It allows for better control over how data is accessed and modified.

30. **What is the access control specifier in C++ and Java?**

    - In C++, access control specifiers (`public`, `private`, and `protected`) are keywords used to specify the level of access to class members. In Java, access control specifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`, and default) are also used to specify the level of access to class members, but with some differences in visibility.

31. **How do you implement access control in classes?**

    - In C++, access control is implemented using access control specifiers (`public`, `private`, and `protected`) in the class definition to specify the visibility of members. In Java, access control is implemented similarly, but with the addition of package-private (default) access level.

32. **What is a constructor? How is it different from a normal member function?**

    - A constructor is a special member function of a class used to initialize objects of the class. It has the same name as the class and is automatically called when an object of the class is created. Unlike normal member functions, constructors do not have a return type and cannot be called explicitly.

33. **Explain the concept of constructor overloading.**

    - Constructor overloading is the ability to have multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists. It allows objects of the class to be initialized in different ways depending on the parameters passed to the constructor.

34. **What is a destructor? When is it called?**

    - A destructor is a special member function of a class used to perform cleanup tasks when an object is destroyed. It has the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (`~`) and is automatically called when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.

35. **How do you create a copy constructor in C++ and Java?**

    - In C++, a copy constructor is a constructor that takes a reference to another object of the same class as its parameter and initializes a new object by copying the contents of the parameter object. In Java, a copy constructor is implemented similarly, but Java does not support explicit copy constructors, so a constructor with the same parameter type as the class can be used to achieve the same effect.

36. **What is the default constructor? When is it invoked?**

    - The default constructor is a constructor that is automatically generated by the compiler if no constructor is explicitly defined in a class. It initializes the object with default values or performs no initialization if no default values are provided. It is invoked automatically when an object is created without any arguments.

37. **Explain the concept of constructor chaining.**

    - Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor within the same class or from a derived class to a base class. It allows code reuse and ensures that common initialization tasks are performed by all constructors.

38. **What is a constructor initializer list?**

    - A constructor initializer list is a list of member initializations separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses that appears after the constructor's parameter list and before its body. It is used to initialize base class subobjects and member objects before the constructor body is executed.

39. **What is a parameterized constructor?**

    - A parameterized constructor is a constructor that accepts one or more parameters to initialize the object with specific values. It allows objects to be initialized differently based on the values passed to the constructor.

40. **What is the purpose of the 'this' pointer/reference in C++ and Java?**

    - In both C++ and Java, the 'this' pointer/reference is a special pointer/reference that points to the current object. It is used to refer to the object's members within its own member functions and to disambiguate between local variables and class members with the same name.

41. **Explain the use of 'super' keyword in Java.**

    - In Java, the 'super' keyword is used to refer to the superclass of the current object. It can be used to call superclass constructors, access superclass methods and fields, and invoke superclass implementations of overridden methods.

42. **What is the 'new' operator used for in C++ and Java?**

    - In both C++ and Java, the 'new' operator is used to dynamically allocate memory for objects on the heap. It returns a pointer/reference to the newly allocated object.

43. **What is a destructor? When is it called?**

    - A destructor is a special member function of a class used to perform cleanup tasks when an object is destroyed. It is called automatically when the object goes out of scope, is explicitly deleted, or when the program exits.

44. **What is a shallow copy? How is it different from a deep copy?**

    - A shallow copy is a copy of an object that copies only the top-level structure of the object, including its member variables. It does not create copies of dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the object's pointers. A deep copy, on the other hand, creates a complete copy of the object, including copies of all dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the object's pointers.

45. **What is the difference between stack and heap memory allocation?**

    - Stack memory allocation is used for storing local variables and function call information in a program's stack frame. It is managed automatically by the compiler and is typically faster but limited in size. Heap memory allocation is used for dynamically allocated memory and is managed explicitly by the programmer. It is slower but offers more flexibility in memory allocation and size.

46. **What is the scope resolution operator (::) used for in C++?**

    - In C++, the scope resolution operator (::) is used to specify the scope of a global variable, function, or namespace or to access static members of a class.

47. **How do you implement method overriding in Java?**

    - In Java, method overriding is achieved by providing a specific implementation of a method in a subclass that has the same signature (name, parameters, return type) as a method in its superclass. The '@Override' annotation can be used to indicate that a method is intended to override a superclass method.

48. **Explain the concept of method hiding in Java.**

    - Method hiding in Java occurs when a subclass declares a static method with the same signature as a static method in its superclass. The subclass method "hides" the superclass method, meaning that the subclass method will be invoked when called on objects of the subclass, even if the superclass method exists.

49. **What is an inner class in Java?**

    - An inner class in Java is a class defined within another class. It has access to the members of the enclosing class and can be declared as static or non-static. Inner classes are often used to logically group classes and improve encapsulation.

50. **Explain the concept of function overloading with an example.**

    - Function overloading is the ability to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists in a class or namespace. For example, you can define multiple `add()` functions that take different numbers or types of parameters, such as `int add(int a, int b)` and `double add(double a, double b)`.

51. **What is the purpose of the 'extends' keyword in Java?**

    - In Java, the 'extends' keyword is used to establish an inheritance relationship between classes. It indicates that a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass.

52. **How do you implement method overriding in C++?**

    - In C++, method overriding is achieved by defining a function in a derived class with the same signature (name, parameters, return type) as a virtual function in its base class. The 'virtual' keyword is used to declare a function as virtual in the base class, and the 'override' specifier can be used in the derived class to indicate that a function is intended to override a base class function.

53. **What is the role of the 'super' keyword in Java constructors?**

    - In Java, the 'super' keyword is used to invoke superclass constructors from subclass constructors. It can be used to call superclass constructors with specific arguments or to call superclass constructors implicitly if no arguments are provided.

54. **What is a static initializer block in Java?**

    - A static initializer block in Java is a block of code enclosed in curly braces that is executed once when the class is loaded into memory. It is used to initialize static variables or perform other initialization tasks that need to be done before the class is used.

55. **How do you create an object of a class in C++?**

    - In C++, an object of a class is created by using the 'new' operator followed by the class name and constructor arguments (if any). For example, `ClassName *obj = new ClassName();`.

56. **What is the role of the 'this' keyword in Java constructors?**

    - In Java, the 'this' keyword refers to the current object instance within a constructor. It can be used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name, or to call other constructors of the same class using constructor chaining.

57. **Explain the concept of constructor chaining with an example.**

    - Constructor chaining in Java is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor within the same class using the 'this' keyword. It allows for code reuse and ensures that common initialization tasks are performed by all constructors. For example:

      ```java
      public class MyClass {
          private int value;

          public MyClass() {
              this(0); // Call parameterized constructor with default value
          }

          public MyClass(int value) {
              this.value = value;
          }
      }
      ```
