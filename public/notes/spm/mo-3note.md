## objectives of Activity Planning, (page - 2 ative pdf )

the objectives of activity planning in project management. Activity planning is the process of breaking down a project into smaller, manageable tasks and scheduling them in a logical order. There are five objectives of activity planning:

- **Feasibility assessment**: To determine if the project is possible within the given time and resource constraints, and to forecast a realistic completion date based on the estimated effort and the availability of staff.
- **Resource allocation**: To find the most effective ways of assigning resources, such as people, tools, and budget, to the project tasks, and to explore the trade-off between time and resource availability.
- **Detailed costing**: To calculate how much the project will cost and when the expenditure will occur, based on the activity plan and the allocated resources.
- **Motivation**: To provide targets and monitor progress against them, as a way of motivating the staff, especially if they have participated in setting the targets.
- **Coordination**: To coordinate the staff in different departments and teams, and to manage the transfer of staff between projects, using the project plan as a guide.

## Projects and Activities,(page - 5 ative pdf )

- A project is a set of related activities that have a common goal and a defined start and end point.
- An activity is a unit of work that produces a tangible output or deliverable, such as a document, a software module, or a test result.
- Activities have resource and time requirements that can be estimated and planned in advance.
- Activities have logical dependencies or relationships with other activities, which determine the order or sequence in which they can be performed. Some activities cannot start until others are finished, while some can be done in parallel or overlap.

The activities or tasks that are required to complete a project. there are three different methods for doing this:

- The **activity-based approach** starts with listing all the activities that the project involves, and then organizes them into a hierarchical structure called a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The WBS shows the dependencies and relationships among the activities, and helps to estimate the time and resources needed for each activity.
- The **product-based approach** starts with identifying all the products or deliverables that the project will produce, and then creates a Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) and a Product Flow Diagram (PFD). The PBS shows the components and subcomponents of each product, and the PFD shows the inputs and outputs of each product. The products can then be transformed into activities by describing the work needed to create them.
- The **hybrid approach** combines the activity-based and product-based approaches, and creates a WBS that is based on both the activities and the products of the project. This approach can be more flexible and adaptable to different types of projects and methodologies.

## Categories of Risk

The selected text is part of a web page about risk management in ICT projects. The text explains some of the concepts and challenges related to identifying and dealing with risks that could affect the success of a project. The text covers the following points:

- An ICT project manager is usually given a set of objectives to achieve, such as delivering a software application within a certain time and budget, and meeting some quality standards. These objectives could be jeopardized by various factors that are uncertain or unpredictable, which are called project risks.
- Project risks are different from business risks, which are related to the value or usefulness of the software application after it is implemented. For example, a project risk could be that the development team lacks the necessary skills or experience, while a business risk could be that the customers do not like or buy the product. Project risks are usually the responsibility of the project manager and the development team, while business risks are usually the responsibility of the project sponsor or the client.
- There are different ways of categorizing risks, depending on the perspective or the framework used. One example is the sociotechnical model of risk, proposed by Lyytinen, Mathiassen and Ropponen, which divides risks into four categories: actors, technology, structure and tasks. Each category refers to a different aspect of the project environment and the potential sources of problems. For example, actors are the people involved in the project, such as developers, users, managers, etc. Technology refers to the tools and methods used to create and deliver the software product. Structure refers to the organizational and managerial arrangements and systems that support the project. Tasks are the work activities that need to be performed to complete the project. Risks can arise from any of these categories, or from the interactions between them.

## A Framework for Dealing with Risk:

- Risk Identification
- Risk assessment
- Risk planning
- Risk Mangement

A framework for dealing with risk is a set of guidelines and processes that help an organization identify, assess, plan, and manage the risks it faces in its operations and activities. The framework aims to balance the potential benefits and costs of taking risks, while minimizing the negative impacts of uncertainty and volatility.

The framework consists of four main steps:

- **Risk Identification**: This step involves defining the scope and sources of risk, and listing all the possible risks that the organization may encounter. Some common types of risk include financial, operational, strategic, legal, regulatory, and reputational. Risk identification can be done using various methods, such as brainstorming, interviews, surveys, checklists, and historical data analysis.
- **Risk Assessment**: This step involves measuring and evaluating the likelihood and impact of each risk, and prioritizing them based on their significance and urgency. Risk assessment can be done using various tools, such as risk matrices, probability distributions, scenario analysis, and sensitivity analysis.
- **Risk Planning**: This step involves developing and selecting appropriate strategies and actions to address the identified risks. Some common strategies for risk management are avoidance, reduction, transfer, sharing, and retention. Risk planning can be done using various techniques, such as cost-benefit analysis, decision trees, and contingency plans.
- **Risk Management**: This step involves implementing, monitoring, and reviewing the chosen risk strategies and actions, and adjusting them as needed based on the changing risk environment and feedback. Risk management can be done using various mechanisms, such as risk registers, risk reports, risk audits, and risk reviews.

A framework for dealing with risk can help an organization achieve its objectives and enhance its performance by enabling it to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to various risks in a systematic and effective manner.

### summery

- **Risk Identification:** Systematically identifying potential risks that could impact the project.
- **Risk Assessment:** Evaluating the potential impact and likelihood of each identified risk.
- **Risk Planning:** Developing strategies and contingency plans to address and mitigate the identified risks.
- **Risk Management:** Implementing and monitoring risk responses throughout the project life cycle.

## Risk planning

- Risk acceptance
- Risk avoidance
- Risk reduction
- Risk transfer

- **Risk acceptance**: This means accepting the possibility and consequences of a risk, without taking any action to prevent or reduce it. This strategy is usually chosen when the risk is low or unavoidable, or when the cost of mitigation is higher than the potential impact of the risk¹.
- **Risk avoidance**: This means avoiding the risk by changing the project plan, scope, schedule, or resources. This strategy is usually chosen when the risk is high or unacceptable, or when the cost of avoidance is lower than the potential impact of the risk¹.
- **Risk reduction**: This means reducing the likelihood or impact of a risk by implementing some preventive or corrective actions. This strategy is usually chosen when the risk is moderate or manageable, or when the cost of reduction is reasonable compared to the potential impact of the risk¹.
- **Risk transfer**: This means transferring the risk to a third party, such as an insurance company, a contractor, or a supplier. This strategy is usually chosen when the risk is beyond the control or expertise of the project team, or when the cost of transfer is affordable compared to the potential impact of the risk¹.

## Nature of Resources

In general, resources will fall into one of seven categories:

- Labour
- Equipment
- Materials
- Space
- Services
- Time
- Money

- **Labour**: This refers to the human workforce involved in a project or activity. Labour can be skilled or unskilled, and can perform various tasks such as physical, mental, or creative work. Labour is a vital resource for any organization or economy.
- **Equipment**: This refers to the tools, machines, vehicles, or devices that are used to perform a task or produce a product. Equipment can be fixed or movable, and can vary in size, complexity, and cost. Equipment is often used to enhance the efficiency or quality of labour or materials.
- **Materials**: This refers to the raw or processed substances that are used to create a product or service. Materials can be natural or synthetic, and can have different properties such as durability, strength, or flexibility. Materials are often consumed or transformed during the production process.
- **Space**: This refers to the physical area or location that is used for a project or activity. Space can be indoor or outdoor, and can have different characteristics such as size, shape, or accessibility. Space is often used to store, display, or operate equipment or materials.
- **Services**: This refers to the intangible or non-material benefits that are provided by one party to another. Services can be personal or professional, and can involve various activities such as teaching, consulting, or repairing. Services are often delivered by labour or equipment, and can satisfy a need or want of the customer.
- **Time**: This refers to the duration or period that is available or required for a project or activity. Time can be measured in various units such as seconds, minutes, hours, or days, and can have different constraints such as deadlines, schedules, or priorities. Time is often used to plan, coordinate, or execute labour, equipment, materials, space, or services.
- **Money**: This refers to the medium of exchange or value that is used to acquire or pay for a resource. Money can be in various forms such as cash, cheque, credit, or debit, and can have different denominations such as rupees, dollars, or euros. Money is often used to measure, compare, or allocate labour, equipment, materials, space, services, or time.
