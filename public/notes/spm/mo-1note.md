# Activities Covered by Software Project Management

A software project is not only concerned with the actual writing of
software. ln fact, where a software application is bought in 'off
the shelf', there may be no software writing as such, but this is still
fundamentally a software project because so many of the other activities
associated with software will still be present.
Usually there are three successive processes that bring a new system
into being - see Figure 1 .2.

### FIGURE 1.2 The feasibility study/plan/execution cycle

1. **_The feasibility study_** assesses whether a `project is worth starting` -
   that it has a valid business case. lnformation is gathered about the
   requirements of the proposed application.` Requiremerrts` elicitation
   can, at least initially, be complex and difficult. The stakeholders may
   know the aims they wish to pursue, but not be sure about the means of
   achievernetrt. The developmental and operational `costs`, and the value
   of the benefits of the new system, will also have to be estimated. With a large system,
   the feasibility study could be a project in its own right with its own plan. The study
   could be part of a strategic planning exercise examining a range of potential software
   developments. Sometimes an organization assesses a programme of development
   made up of a number of projects.

2. **_Planning_** lf the feasibility study indicates that the prospective project
   appears viable, then project planning can start. For larger projects, we
   would not do all our detailed planning at the beginning. We create an
   `outline plan for the whole project` and a` detailed one for the first stage`.
   Because we will have more detailed and accurate project information
   approach to after the earlier stages of the project have been completed,`planning of the later stages is left to nearer their start.`

3. **_Project execution_** The project can now be executed. The `execution`
   of a project often contains `design and implementation` sub-phases.
   Students new to project planning often find that the boundary between
   design and planning can be hazy. `Design` is making decisions about
   the form of the producfs to be created. This could relate to the `external appearance`
   of the software, that is, the user interface, or the internal architecture. `The plan details the activities to be carried out to create these products`. planning and design can be
   confused because at the most detailed level, planning decisions are influenced by
   design decisions. Thus a software product with five major components is likely to
   require five sets of activities to create them.

- **_Requirements analysis_** `starts with requirements gathering of requirements which establishes what the potential users and their managers require of the new system`. It could relate to a function
  that the system should do something. It coulcl be a quality requirement
  how well the functions must work. An example of this is dispatching an
  ambulance in response to an emergency telephone call. ln this case transaction time
  would be affected by hardware and software performance as well as the speed of
  human operation. Training to ensure that operators use the computer system efficiently
  is an example of a system requirement for the project, as opposed to a specifically
  software requirement There would also be resource requirements that relate to
  appl ication development costs.

- **_Architecture design_** `The components of the new system that fulfil each requirement have to be identified. Existing components may be able to satisfy some requirements. In other cases/ a new component will have to be made. These components are not only software: they could be new hardware or work processes.` Although software
  developers are primarily concerned with software components, it is very rare that these
  can be developed in isolation. They will, for example, have to take account of existing
  legacy systems with which they will interoperate. The design of the system architecture
  is thus an input to the software requiremenfs. A second architecture design process then
  takes place that maps the software requirements to software components.

- **_Detailed design_** Each software component is made up of a number of software units
  that can be separately coded and tested. The `detailed design of these units is carried out separately.`

- **_Code and test refers_** to writing code for each software unit.` lnitial testing to debug individual software units` would be carried out at this stage.

- **_Integration_**` The components are tested together to see if they meet the overall requirements.` Integration coulcl involve combirring different software components,
  or combining and testing the software element of the system in conjunction with the
  hardware platforms and user interactions.

- **_Qualification testing_** The system, includirrg the software components, has to be tested
  carefully to ensure that `all the requiremerrts have been fulfilled`.

- **_Installation_** This is the process of making the new system operational. It woulcl include
  activities such as setting up standing data (for example, the details for employees in a
  payroll system), `setting system parameters, installing the software onto the hardware platforms and user training`.

- **_Acceptance support_** This is the resolving of problems with the newly installed system,
  including the correction of any errors, and implementing agreed extensions and
  improvements. Software maintenance can be seen as a series of minor software
  projects. In many environments, nlost software development is in fact maintenance. `maintenance and help  and feadback`

# Some ways of categorizing software projects

projects may differ because of the different technical products to be created. Thus we
need to identify the characteristics of a project which could affect the way in which it
should be planrred and nranaged. Other factors are discussed below .

**_Compulsory versus voluntary users_**

- In workplaces there are systems that staff have to use if they want to do something, such
  as recording a sale. However, use of a system is increasingly voluntary, as in the case of
  computer games. Here it is difficult to elicit precise requirements from potential users as
  we could with a business system. What the game will do will thus depend much on the
  informed ingenuity of the developers, along with techniques such as market surveys, focus
  groups arrd prototype evaluation.

**_Information systems versus emhedded systems_**

- A traditional distinction has been between information systems which
  enable staff to carry out office processes and embedded systems which
  corrtrol machines. A stock control system would be an information system.
  An embedded, or process control, system might control the air conditioning
  equipment in a building. Some systems may have elements of both where,
  for exanrple, the stock control systetn also controls an automated
  warehouse.

**_Objectives versus products_**

- Projects may be distinguished by whether their aim is to produce a product or to meet
  certain objectives.
- A project might be to create a product, the details of which have been specified by the
  client. The client has the resporrsibility for justifying the product.

- On the other hand, the project requirement might be to meet certain
  objectives which could be met in a number of ways. An organization
  might have a problem and ask a specialist to recommend a solution.
  Many software projects have two stages. First is an objective-driven
  project resulting in recommendations. This might identify the need for a
  new software system. The next stage is a project actrrally to create the
  software Product.

- This is useful where the technical work is being done by an external
  group and the user needs are unclear at the outset.The external group can
  produce a preliminary design at a fixed fee. lf the design is acceptable the
  developers can then quote a price for the second, implementation, stage based on an
  agreed requirement.

# A business Case

Organizations may have different titles such as a feasibility
study or a project justification for what we call the business
case. Its objective is to provide a rationale for the project by
showing that the benefits of the project outcomes will exceed
the costs of development, implementatíon and operation (or
production).

Typically a busíness case document might contain:

1.  Introduction and background to the proposal
2.  The proposed project
3.  The market
4.  Organizational and operational infrastructure
5.  The benefits
6.  Outline implementation Plan
7.  Costs
8.  The financial case
9.  Risks
10. Management plan

These sections will be now be described in more detail

1.  **_Introduction and background to the proposal_**

- This ís a description of the current envíronment of the proposed project, A problem to be
  solved or an opportunity to be exploited is identified

2.  **_The proposed project_**

- A brief outline of the proposed project is provided

3.  **_The market_**

- This is needed when the project is to create new product or a new service
  capability. This would contain information like the estimated demand for
  the product or service and any likely competitors.

4.  **_Organizational and operational infrastructure_**

- This describes how the structure of the organization will be affected by the
  implementation of the project. This is of most relevance where the project
  is implementing or modifying an information system as part of a broader business change
  project. lt would also be relevant if a tailored production or distribution system has to be
  set up when a new product is designed.

5.  **_The benefits_**

- Where possible, a financial value should be put on the benefits of the implemented
  project. For commercial organizations this could be related to increased profits caused
  either by increasing income or by making savings on costs. For not-for-profit organizations
  we would try to quantify the benefits even if we cannot quote a precise financial value.
  ln an example we used earlier relating to an lT system that improved the diagnosis of a
  particular disease, an increase in the rate of diagnosis might be quoted,

6.  **_Outline implementation Plan_**

- In addition to the ICT aspects of the project, activities such as marketing, promotion
  and operational and maintenance infrastructures need to be considered. One
  consideration will be which project activities can be outsourced, and which are best
  kept in-house.
- This will also detail the management of the implementation. The responsibilities are
  allocated for the tasks identified in the outline implementation plan. Key decision points
  or milestones, where a health-check on the state of the implementation is taken, should be
  identified. As we wilI see, for a large implementation a number of projects may be needed
  which can be managed as a programme.

7.  **_Costs_**

- Having outlined the steps needed to set up the operations needed by the proposal, a
  schedule of expected costs associated with the planned approach can now be presented

- There will clearly be some uncertainties about some of the costs, especially as the
  details of the requirements have not yet been worked out.

8.  **_The financial case_**

- There are a number of ways in which the information on income and costs can be
  analysed and there are many evaluation techniques

9.  **_Risks_**

- In this many estimates of costs and, more particularly, benefits of the project will be
  speculative at this stage and the section on risk should take account of this.
  distinguish project risk relating to threats to successful project execution - from business
  risk - relating to factors threatening the benefits of the delivered project. In the business
  case the main focus is on business risk

# Project portfolio management

Project portfolio management provides an overview of all the projects
that an organization is undertaking or ís considering. lt prioritizes the
allocation of resources to projects and decides which new projects should
be accepted and which existing ones should be dropped.
The concerns of project portfolio management include:

- identifying which project proposals are worth implementation;

- assessing the amount of risk of failure that a potential project has;

- deciding how to share limited resources, including staff time and
  finance, between projects - one problem can be that too many projects
  are started given the resources available so that inevitably some projects
  will miss planned completion dates;

- being aware of the depenclencies between projects, especially where
  several projects need to be completed for an organization to reap
  benefits;

- ensuring hat projects do not duplicate work;

- ensuring that necessary developments have not been inadvertently been missed.

The three key aspects of project portfolio management are `portfolio definition, portfolio management and portfolio optimization`. An organization would undertake portfolio
definition before adopting portfolio management and then proceeding to optimization.

**_Project portfolio definition_**

An organization should record in a single repository details of all current projects.
A decision will be needed about whether projects of all types are to be included. Should
just ICT projects be included in the repository, or should other proiects such as the setting up of a new warehouse also be included? One problem for many organizations is that projects can be divided into new product development (NPD) where the project deliverable is a product, such as
a computer game, that is sold to customers, and renewal projects which
improve the way an organization operates - information systems projects
are often like this. The distinction is not always clear-cut. For example,
a new information system could be used to provide a customer service
such as recording the details of people buying a new insurance product.

NPD projects are often more frequent in organizations which have
a continuous development of new goods and services. Renewal projects may be less
frequent and thus inherently more risky as there is less experience of these types of
project. NPD projects find attracting funding easier with their clear relationship
between the project and inconre. Where both types of project call upon the same
pools of resources, including finance, the argument for a common portfolio is strong.

**_Project portfolio management_**

Once the portfolio has been established, more detailed costings of projects can be
recorded.The value that managers hope will be generated by each project can also
be recorded. Actual performance of projects on these performance indicators can then
be tracked. This information can be the basis for the more rigorous screening of new
projects.

**_Project portfolio optimization_**

The performance of the portfolio can be tracked by high-level managers on a regular
basis. A better balance of projects may be achieved. Some projects could potentially be
very profitable but could also be risky. In the case of an e-commerce site, for example,
sales may not be as great as hoped because established competitors reduce prices. Other
projects could have modest benefits, such as those cutting costs by automating processes,
but have fewer risks. The portfolio ought to have a carefully thoughout balance between
the two types of project

## Some problems with project portfolio management

An important role of project portfolio management is sharing resources
between projects. There can be problems because while apparently
fulltime staff are allocated to a project, they may effectively be part-time
because they still have routine work to do. This is particularly so with
users, and with developers who may on occasion be called away from
project work to deal with support tasks.

The official project portfolio may not accurately reflect orgarrizational
activity if some projects are excluded. A formal decision mary be made that
only projects over a certairr level of cost will be recorded in the portfolio.

<!--
I he 'below the lirre'projects could in fact consume sul¡stantial staff effort
bleed away effort from the official projects. lt can be argued that all
projects should be included in the official portfolio.

However, there are advantages in allowing tlrese tasks. lt allows
small ad hoc tasks to tre done, such as qurick fixes to systems to deal with
externally imposed changes. They reduce work for higher management by
saving them from having to process a large number of small work requests
Devetpers may firrd these small tasks rewarding: dealing with these
small requests is an easy way to keep r-rsers happy. Thus when allocating
resources to projects, a margin should be set to allow first-line managers some judgement
in accepting non-planned work. -->
