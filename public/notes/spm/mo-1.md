- **Contract Management:** Involves handling agreements with clients, vendors, and stakeholders. Ensures that the project adheres to contractual obligations.
- **Technical Project Management:** Focuses on the technical aspects of project execution, including planning, implementation, and monitoring of technical tasks.

## 5. **Activities Covered by Software Project Management:**

- **Planning:** Defining project goals, scope, schedule, and resources.
- **Execution:** Carrying out the project plan.
- **Monitoring and Controlling:** Tracking progress, managing changes, and ensuring adherence to the plan.
- **Closing:** Finalizing all project activities and delivering the product.

## 6. **Plans, Methods, and Methodologies:**

- **Plans:** Detailed outlines specifying how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled.
- **Methods:** Specific techniques and procedures used to complete tasks within the project.
- **Methodologies:** Comprehensive approaches that guide the entire project, such as Agile or Waterfall methodologies.

## 7. **Some Ways of Categorizing Software Projects:**

- **Size:** Small, medium, or large projects.
- **Nature:** Enhancement, maintenance, or new development projects.
- **Application Domain:** Different industries or sectors.

## 8. **Project Evaluation and Programme Management:**

- **Project Evaluation:** Assessing the success and performance of a project after completion.
- **Programme Management:** Coordinating and managing multiple related projects to achieve strategic objectives.

## 9. **Overview of Project Planning:**

- **Project Planning:** Involves defining project goals, scope, tasks, schedules, and resources. It sets the foundation for project execution and control.

Understanding these topics provides a comprehensive insight into the field of software project management, offering tools and methodologies to successfully navigate the complexities of software development projects.
