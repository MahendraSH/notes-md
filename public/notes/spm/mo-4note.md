## work flow of process and big table ( `software process work flows 5 Eg` )

SOFTWARE PROCESS WORKFLOWS
The term WORKFLOWS is used to mean a thread of cohesive and mostly sequential activities. Workflows are
mapped to product artifacts There are seven top-level workflows:

1. Management workflow: controlling the process and ensuring win conditions for all stakeholders
2. Environment workflow: automating the process and evolving the maintenance environment
3. Requirements workflow: analyzing the problem space and evolving the requirements artifacts
4. Design workflow: modeling the solution and evolving the architecture and design artifacts
5. Implementation workflow: programming the components and evolving the implementation and
   deployment artifacts
6. Assessment workflow: assessing the trends in process and product quality
7. Deployment workflow: transitioning the end products to the user

## Iteratn emphasis of life cycle

### ITERATION WORKFLOWS

![Alt text](https://notes-mds.vercel.app/notes/spm/image-3.png)

Iteration consists of a loosely sequential set of activities in various proportions, depending on where the
iteration is located in the development cycle. Each iteration is defined in terms of a set of allocated usage
scenarios. An individual iteration's workflow, illustrated in Figure 8-2, generally includes the following
sequence:

- Management: iteration planning to determine the content of the release and develop the detailed plan
  for the iteration; assignment of work packages, or tasks, to the development team
- Environment: evolving the software change order database to reflect all new baselines and changes to
  existing baselines for all product, test, and environment components
- Requirements: analyzing the baseline plan, the baseline architecture, and the baseline requirements
  set artifacts to fully elaborate the use cases to be demonstrated at the end of this iteration and their
  evaluation criteria; updating any requirements set artifacts to reflect changes necessitated by results
  of this iteration's engineering activities
- Design: evolving the baseline architecture and the baseline design set artifacts to elaborate fully the
  design model and test model components necessary to demonstrate against the evaluation criteria
  allocated to this iteration; updating design set artifacts to reflect changes necessitated by the results
  of this iteration's engineering activities
- Implementation: developing or acquiring any new components, and enhancing or modifying any
  existing components, to demonstrate the evaluation criteria allocated to this iteration; integrating and
  testing all new and modified components with existing baselines (previous versions)
- Assessment: evaluating the results of the iteration, including compliance with the allocated
  evaluation criteria and the quality of the current baselines; identifying any rework required and
  determining whether it should be performed before deployment of this release or allocated to the
  next release; assessing results to improve the basis of the subsequent iteration's plan
- Deployment: transitioning the release either to an external organization (such as a user, independent
  verification and validation contractor, or regulatory agency) or to internal closure by conducting a
  post-mortem so that lessons learned can be captured and reflected in the next iteration

## Checkpoints full

Three types of joint management reviews are conducted throughout the process:

1. Major milestones. These system wide events are held at the end of each development phase. They
   provide visibility to system wide issues, synchronize the management and engineering perspectives,
   and verify that the aims of the phase have been achieved.
2. Minor milestones. These iteration-focused events are conducted to review the content of an iteration
   in detail and to authorize continued work.
3. Status assessments. These periodic events provide management with frequent and regular insight
   into the progress being made.

## Major Mile Stones,

The four major milestones occur at the transition points between life-cycle phases. They can be used in many
different process models, including the conventional waterfall model. In an iterative model, the major
milestones are used to achieve concurrence among all stakeholders on the current state of the project. Different
stakeholders have very different concerns:

- Customers: schedule and budget estimates, feasibility, risk assessment, requirements understanding,
  progress, product line compatibility
- Users: consistency with requirements and usage scenarios, potential for accommodating growth,
  quality attributes
- Architects and systems engineers: product line compatibility, requirements changes, trade-off
  analyses, completeness and consistency, balance among risk, quality, and usability
- Developers: sufficiency of requirements detail and usage scenario descriptions, . frameworks for
  component selection or development, resolution of development risk, product line compatibility,
  sufficiency of the development environment
- Maintainers: sufficiency of product and documentation artifacts, understandability, interoperability
  with existing systems, sufficiency of maintenance environment
- Others: possibly many other perspectives by stakeholders such as regulatory agencies, independent
  verification and validation contractors, venture capital investors, subcontractors, associate contractors,
  and sales and marketing teams

  ### Life-Cycle Objectives Milestone

  The life-cycle objectives milestone occurs at the end of the inception phase. The goal is to present to all
  stakeholders a recommendation on how to proceed with development, including a plan, estimated cost and
  schedule, and expected benefits and cost savings. A successfully completed life-cycle objectives milestone will
  result in authorization from all stakeholders to proceed with the elaboration phase.

  ### Life-Cycle Architecture Milestone

  The life-cycle architecture milestone occurs at the end of the elaboration phase. The primary goal is to
  demonstrate an executable architecture to all stakeholders. The baseline architecture consists of both a human readable representation (the architecture document) and a configuration-controlled set of software components
  captured in the engineering artifacts. A successfully completed life-cycle architecture milestone will result in
  authorization from the stakeholders to proceed with the construction phase.

### Initial Operational Capability Milestone

The initial operational capability milestone occurs late in the construction phase. The goals are to assess the
readiness of the software to begin the transition into customer/user sites and to authorize the start of acceptance
testing. Acceptance testing can be done incrementally across multiple iterations or can be completed entirely
during the transition phase is not necessarily the completion of the construction phase.

### Product Release Milestone

The product release milestone occurs at the end of the transition phase. The goal is to assess the completion of
the software and its transition to the support organization, if any. The results of acceptance testing are
reviewed, and all open issues are addressed. Software quality metrics are reviewed to determine whether
quality is sufficient for transition to the support organization.

## Minor Milestones,

For most iterations, which have a one-month to six-month duration, only two minor milestones are needed: the
iteration readiness review and the iteration assessment review.

- Iteration Readiness Review. This informal milestone is conducted at the start of each iteration to
  review the detailed iteration plan and the evaluation criteria that have been allocated to this iteration.
- Iteration Assessment Review. This informal milestone is conducted at the end of each iteration to
  assess the degree to which the iteration achieved its objectives and satisfied its evaluation criteria, to
  review iteration results, to review qualification test results (if part of the iteration), to determine the
  amount of rework to be done, and to review the impact of the iteration results on the plan for
  subsequent iterations

## ITERATION PLANNING PROCESS:

The text you selected is about the iteration planning process in agile software development. Iteration planning is a way of organizing and managing the work of a project team into short cycles of development, testing, and feedback. Each cycle, or iteration, has a fixed duration, usually between one and four weeks, and produces a working version of the software that can be demonstrated to the stakeholders¹.

The text describes four types of iterations that are commonly used in agile projects:

- Inception iterations: These are the initial iterations that aim to define the scope, vision, and architecture of the project. They involve prototyping, requirements analysis, and risk assessment. The goal is to establish a feasible and viable business case and a software development plan².
- Elaboration iterations: These are the iterations that focus on developing and refining the architecture of the system. They involve implementing and testing the most critical and complex features and scenarios. The goal is to achieve a stable and scalable architecture that can support the future development².
- Construction iterations: These are the iterations that focus on delivering the functionality and quality of the system. They involve implementing and testing the remaining features and scenarios, as well as addressing any defects, technical debt, or refactoring needs. The goal is to produce a reliable and usable software product that meets the expectations of the stakeholders².
- Transition iterations: These are the final iterations that focus on deploying and releasing the system to the end users. They involve performing any necessary integration, configuration, documentation, training, or support activities. The goal is to ensure a smooth and successful transition of the software product from the development team to the operations team².

The text also suggests a general guideline for the number and duration of iterations in a typical agile project. It recommends using between four and nine iterations, with a total duration of six to nine months. It also provides an example of a six-iteration profile, with one inception iteration, two elaboration iterations, two construction iterations, and one transition iteration².

## Pragmatic planning.

The selected text is a part of the web page that discusses the topic of software project management. It is from the section titled "Pragmatic Planning", which is the last subsection of the section "Iterative Process Planning". The text explains the concept and benefits of pragmatic planning, which is a way of planning software projects that adapts to the changing circumstances and feedback from each iteration. The text also contrasts pragmatic planning with conventional planning, which is often too rigid or unrealistic.

An explanation for the text could be:

- **Pragmatic planning** is a flexible and realistic approach to software project management that involves making adjustments and trade-offs based on the results of each iteration.
- **Iteration** is a cycle of activities that produces a demonstrable intermediate result, such as a prototype, an architecture, or a release.
- **Project plan** is a document that defines how the project requirements will be met within the given constraints, such as budget, schedule, quality, and resources.
- **Project manager** is the person who is responsible for planning, monitoring, controlling, and leading the software project.
- **Stakeholders** are the people who have an interest or influence in the software project, such as customers, users, developers, testers, managers, etc.
- **Pragmatic planning** helps to avoid common problems such as bad architectures, misunderstood requirements, inadequate planning, and bad management, which can lead to project failures.
- **Pragmatic planning** also helps to achieve project success by ensuring that the project plan is realistic, current, collaborative, understood, and used by all stakeholders.
- **Pragmatic planning** fosters a culture of teamwork and ownership among the project team members, who are more involved and committed to the planning process and results.

## Recuritment process

The text is about the recruitment process for project leaders who need to select the best people for their team. The main ideas are:

- Project leaders often have limited choice of staff and have to work with the organizational policy.
- Eligible candidates are not always suitable candidates, and vice versa. Belbin suggests assessing skills and providing training, and avoiding discrimination.
- A general approach for recruitment involves creating a job specification, a job holder profile, and obtaining applicants through advertisement.

- Create a job specification
- Createa job holder profile
- Obtain applicants
- Exantine CVs
- lnterviews etc
- Other prctcedures

- Create a job specification: This is a document that describes the duties, responsibilities, skills, qualifications and experience required for a specific position. It helps to define the expectations and requirements of the job and serves as a basis for evaluating candidates¹.
- Create a job holder profile: This is a document that outlines the characteristics, attributes and competencies of the ideal candidate for the job. It helps to identify the best fit for the role and guides the selection process².
- Obtain applicants: This is the process of attracting and sourcing potential candidates for the job. It involves creating and posting a job advertisement, using various channels such as online platforms, social media, referrals, agencies, etc. It also involves developing a recruitment strategy to target the most suitable and qualified candidates³.
- Examine CVs: This is the process of screening and shortlisting the applicants based on their CVs or resumes. It involves reviewing the CVs to check if they match the job specification and the job holder profile, and eliminating those who do not meet the criteria⁴.
- Interviews etc: This is the process of assessing and evaluating the shortlisted candidates through various methods such as interviews, tests, assessments, etc. It involves asking relevant questions, observing the candidates' behaviour and performance, and verifying their credentials and references.
- Other procedures: This is the process of finalising the recruitment process by making a job offer, negotiating the terms and conditions, signing the contract and welcoming the new employee. It also involves conducting an orientation and induction program, providing training and development opportunities, and giving feedback and support.

## motivation models

- The Taylorist model
- Maslow's hierarchy of needs
- Henberg's two-factor theory
- The expectancy theory of motivation

- **_The Taylorist model_**: This is a classical theory of motivation that was proposed by Frederick Taylor in the early 20th century. It is based on the assumption that workers are motivated by money and that they will perform better if they are paid according to their output. Taylor advocated the use of scientific management techniques, such as time and motion studies, to determine the optimal way of performing a task and to set standard output levels. He also suggested that workers should be supervised closely and rewarded or punished based on their performance.
- **_Maslow's hierarchy of needs_**: This is a humanistic theory of motivation that was proposed by Abraham Maslow in the 1940s. It is based on the assumption that humans have a hierarchy of needs that range from basic physiological needs to higher psychological needs. Maslow suggested that people are motivated to satisfy their lower-level needs first, before moving on to their higher-level needs. He also suggested that people have a need for self-actualization, which is the highest level of motivation and involves fulfilling one's potential.
- **_Herzberg's two-factor theory_**: This is a content theory of motivation that was proposed by Frederick Herzberg in the 1950s. It is based on the assumption that there are two factors that influence worker motivation: hygiene factors and motivators. Hygiene factors are extrinsic factors that are related to the work environment, such as salary, security, working conditions, etc. Herzberg suggested that these factors do not motivate workers, but they can cause dissatisfaction if they are absent or inadequate. Motivators are intrinsic factors that are related to the work itself, such as achievement, recognition, responsibility, etc. Herzberg suggested that these factors motivate workers and increase their satisfaction.
- **_The expectancy theory of motivation_**: This is a process theory of motivation that was proposed by Victor Vroom in the 1960s. It is based on the assumption that people are motivated by the expected outcomes of their actions. Vroom suggested that there are three variables that determine motivation: expectancy, instrumentality, and valence. Expectancy is the belief that one's effort will lead to a desired performance. Instrumentality is the belief that one's performance will lead to a desired outcome. Valence is the value or attractiveness of the outcome. Vroom suggested that motivation is the product of these three variables, and that people will choose the action that has the highest motivation value.

## The Oldham-Hackman Job Characteristics Model

Managers should group together the elements of tasks to be carried out so that they form meaningful and satisfying assignments. Oldham and Hackman suggest that the satisfaction that a job gives is based on five factors. The first three factors make the job &#039;meaningful&#039; to the person who is doing it:

- Skill variety: the number of different skills that the job holder has the opportunity to exercise
  Task identity: the degree to which your work and its results are identifiable as belonging to you
- Task significance: the degree to which your job has an influence on others
  The other two factors are:
- Autonomy: the discretion you have about the way that you do the job
- Feedback: the information you get back about the results of your work

Oldham and Hackman also noted that both the job holders&#039; personal growth needs and their working environment influenced their perception of the job. Some writers have pointed out that if people are happy with their work for other reasons, they are likely to rate it higher on the Oldham-Hackman dimensions anyway. Thus it might be that cause and effect are reversed.

## health and safety

- The text discusses the health and safety issues related to ICT projects, which may involve physical infrastructure or new technologies.
- The text mentions the legal requirements and ethical responsibilities of organizations and project managers to ensure safety in their projects.
- The text suggests some steps to manage safety, such as having a written policy, setting clear objectives, defining roles and responsibilities, and providing feedback and training.
