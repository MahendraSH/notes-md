After entering the ancient well, Fang Wang could not see anything, nor could he probe with his spiritual sense. He could only maintain the protective prohibitions of the Heavenly Dao Imperial Dragon Crown and the Golden Scale White Feather Robe as he continued to descend.

A mysterious force was pulling him down, and he did not struggle against it, hoping to pass through the bottom of the well with the flow.

This time, he was certain that the bottom of the old well connected to the Netherworld.

He had been falling for miles on end, yet there was still no bottom in sight.

Although he had glimpsed the Netherworld before, he had never actually been there. His anticipation for the Netherworld and the Jiu You inheritance was high.

“Come quickly… come quickly…”

As Fang Wang continued to fall, the mysterious voices near his ear became clearer, as if demons were whispering, luring him on.

Jiu You True Person’s strength was far inferior to his, and yet had managed to successfully inherit the Jiu You legacy. Naturally, he was confident in his own abilities.

Of course, he had to consider that the Jiu You True Person who obtained the inheritance could be a completely different person.

The so-called Jiu You inheritance could also be a trap.

Regardless, Fang Wang had to remain cautious.

Though he appeared arrogant against his enemies, every fight saw him exerting his full strength to eliminate his foes without delay.

Sometimes, his arrogance was but a strategy to exert psychological pressure on the enemy.

After a long while.

Suddenly, Fang Wang felt the pulling force disappear, and he immediately opened his eyes. His vision restored, he looked intently around him to find he was still within the abandoned sacred ground, except the sky was dark red, and everything looked dim. Looking down, he saw the dilapidated courtyard he had seen before.

There was a well in the courtyard, identical to the one he had seen on his way in. It was as if he had fallen from the bottom of the well to the sky, only to fall again towards the old well.

Fang Wang quickly landed in the courtyard and approached the old well. As he probed into the well with his spiritual sense, he felt the pulling force once again.

It seemed that this old well was the passageway between the two realms.

Fang Wang went to the wall of the courtyard and looked around. Before arriving in the Netherworld, he had seen many lost souls trying to climb out of the well, so why couldn’t he see any lost souls upon arriving in the Netherworld?

Something was amiss!

Fang Wang listened carefully, searching for the mysterious voices he heard earlier.

“Come quickly… I can’t… hold on much longer…”

The mysterious voice grew incredibly weak, as if on the brink of exhaustion.

Once Fang Wang determined the direction of the voice, he flew towards it on his Flying Sword. He did not hurry, not the least bit anxious about the mysterious voice.

All the while, he observed the Netherworld.

The Netherworld was filled with an invisible pressure, creating an unsettling feeling of being expelled at any moment for him, a creature of the Mortal Realm. However, this sensation was diminishing, an effect he attributed to the Heavenly Dao True Skill.

Separated by the dichotomy of yin and yang, but the Heavenly Dao True Skill contains the mysteries of Yin Yang Xuan Ming Zhen Gong, enabling him to blend perfectly into the Netherworld.

Before long, Fang Wang finally saw the soul beings of the Netherworld—a Three-Legged Elephant as large as a mountain, with two legs on the front half and one larger leg on the back half—thicker than the other two. Its trunk was longer than its entire body, and the tusks on the sides of its nose twisted upward, extremely sharp.

From afar, this elephant soul exuded an immense oppressive force; it was hard to imagine its strength when it was alive.

The elephant soul glanced at Fang Wang with an indifferent gaze, simply taking a look before moving on.

As Fang Wang flew over its head, it still did not attack.

Fang Wang became curious, wondering if it had died and entered the Netherworld or if it had always been a part of the Netherworld?

On his further journey, Fang Wang encountered more and more soul beings, different from the spirits of the Mortal Realm, able to move freely in the Netherworld.

In the Mortal Realm, when a living creature dies, the soul would be trapped at the site of death. It would either enter reincarnation or accumulate resentment and become a malevolent spirit. Only after a long period of cultivation could they gain freedom.

He continued onward.

After traveling roughly a hundred miles or so, he came upon a massive number of soul beings ahead, densely packed, floating between the mountains and covering the firmament.

As Fang Wang drew close, the soul beings turned their heads to look at him, their eyes shooting terrifying red lights.

Fang Wang sighed softly, Imowing it wouldn’t be easy.

He was undaunted. Raising his left hand, the Six Harmonies and Eight

Desolations Seal soared into the air above his head. He tossed the Heavenly Palace Halberd into his left hand and condensed the Rainbow Sword in his right, accelerating his pace.

“Roar—I’

With an earth-shattering roar, countless soul beings charged towards Fang Wang, their force as strong as the ghostly domain of Jiu You True Person.

Fang Wang immediately unleashed the Executioner Immortal Ghost God Sword. The ghostly divine figure appeared behind him, and as he advanced, he swung his sword, sending magnificent sword Qi sweeping across the sky, annihilating soul after soul.

Each strike took at least thousands of souls, and it wasn’t a simple extermination—it was devouring!

As Fang Wang charged into the endless army of soul beings, they were not intimidated by the Executioner Immortal Ghost God Sword. Instead, they became even more frenzied, surging crazily towards him.

Fang Wang kept swinging his sword, the ghostly figure following suit, sending murderous sword Qi toward different directions, unstoppable.

After tearing through dozens of miles, Fang Wang had not yet broken through the soul army, but the ghostly divine figure behind him grew taller, his sword shadow extended to twenty lengths, and his momentum continued to rise.

As Fang Wang fought, he pondered. Could this be the first challenge of the Jiu You legacy?

He suddenly slowed down, stopped in his tracks, and continued to swing his sword, slaying and absorbing the soul beings.

This scene was far more spectacular than the previous battle with Jiu You True

Person. The formations of the Eternal Life Pavilion could not project it, and Fang Wang had already disappeared from all the screens. The spectators were not surprised by this, as they knew Fang Wang had entered the land of opportunity.

Even though the formations of the Eternal Life Pavilion were exquisite, they could not reach every corner of the Qi Tian secret realm; otherwise, there would be no need to hold trials.

The trial itself also had the purpose of exploration.

Fang Wang was immersed in battle, his Spiritual Power depleting quickly, but fortunately, the strength of The Ghostly Divine Sword increased at a rapid pace as well.

During the battle, Fang Wang was also contemplating the path to becoming a Great Saint.

He faintly felt that being a Great Saint was not just a realm, but a status recognized by heaven and earth.

The Descending Dragon Great Saint and the Executioner Immortal Great Saint seemed both capable of traveling between the Mortal Realm and the Netherworld, with the former’s Yin Yang Xuan Ming Zhen Gong providing ample proof, and the latter’s Executioner Immortal Ghost God Sword being nourished by the power of the Netherworld—how could he have never visited the Netherworld?

Fang Wang made up his mind to inquire seriously about the matters of the Great Saint the next time he met Zhou Xue.

After all, Zhou Xue had ascended before and would certainly know much more from the perspective of the Upper Realm.

Thus, after as long as half an hour, Fang Wang had carved out his own Qiankun in this piece of heaven and earth. The dense spectral army had been completely wiped out, and he then settled on a cliff to sit in meditation and gather Qi.

Using the Executioner Immortal Ghost God Sword frequently took a heavy toll on his Spiritual Power. He did not use the reserve Spiritual Power within the Heavenly Dao Imperial Dragon Crown, saving it for a dire situation. With unknown troubles still ahead, he had to be cautious.

The mysterious voice continued to echo in his ears, urging him to move on. The voice had a bewitching effect—had Fang Wang not been practicing the Heavenly Dao True Skill, he might have been led astray.

Two days later.

Fang Wang’s Spiritual Power had been fully restored. He continued on his way.

Two days had passed, and the mysterious voice persisted, indicating that the other party was not yet desperately anxious.

Fang Wang proceeded on his Flying Sword while pondering the origin of that mysterious voice.

After traveling another hundred miles, the road ahead was filled with swirling sandstorms, darkening the skies, a sign of a dangerous place ahead.

Fang Wang hesitated for a moment, then pressed on. Having come this far, the only clue was the guidance of that mysterious voice. He had no choice but to advance unless he encountered an unbeatable force, at which point he would have to retreat.

The Six Harmonies and Eight Desolations Seal shined above Fang Wang’s head, casting a golden light like an umbrella, through which the sandstorm could not penetrate.

Fang Wang spread his divine sense, exploring his surroundings while moving forward.

His divine sense could only cover an area with a radius of ten miles—there was something strange about this sandstorm!

Fang Wang suddenly missed Xiao Zi. With it by his side, the situation would have been at least somewhat less tense, less dreary.

Before long, Fang Wang saw the outline of a building appearing in the distance, a massive structure situated in mid-air. As he got closer, he realized it was perched atop a colossal mountain—a temple on the mountainside.

He quickly flew out of the sandstorm and looked up to see the mountains surrounded by endless whirls of sand, yet the sand did not cover the mountain, as if some power was holding it back.

Due to the sandstorm filling the skies, the already dim mountain area seemed like it was under the cover of night.

Fang Wang arrived at the temple’s gate, which stood thirty feet tall and nearly ten feet wide, with a large plaque bearing four characters.

Grand An Resentment Temple!

Two stone statues stood on either side of the gate, resembling a qilin or a horned lion-tiger, lifelike with eyes glowing as if they could come to life at any moment.

The gate was ajar, darkness within.

Upon reaching this point, the mysterious voice became incredibly loud, as if someone was standing right in front of Fang Wang shouting:

“Hurry in… I can’t hold on much longer… hurry…”

Under the darkness of night, the Grand An Resentment Temple appeared foreboding, and the mysterious voice Fang Wang heard sounded like wailing ghosts and howling wolves, causing him to frown.

Fang Wang’s divine sense probed into the gate but was repelled by an invisible barrier, unable to pry further.

His eyes hardened, and he threw the Heavenly Palace Halberd with force.

With a boom!

The Heavenly Palace Halberd powerfully shattered the gate and charged into the temple, cutting through the darkness and sticking into a colossal wooden column.

Fang Wang squinted towards where the Heavenly Palace Halberd had landed, a thousand meters away, nailed into a doorpost of a large hall in the inner courtyard. In the surrounding darkness, something seemed to be surging subtly, barely visible.

“I didn’t expect a living person would make it here; must be that guy’s doing!”

“Tsk tsk, such a scorching aura. If we eat him, we could save a thousand years of cultivation.”

“Hahaha, he’s so small, how are we going to share?”

“Don’t eat him, it’s not often we encounter a living being, let me play with him!”

Cold, mocking laughter echoed from within the Grand An Resentment Temple, male and female voices, all laced with murderous intent.

In the darkness, these voices were spine-chilling.

Fang Wang felt a slight trepidation in his heart, as this was his first encounter with such a situation, but he was not panicked. He was no longer the junior cultivator who had just embarked on the Great Saint’s Grotto-Heaven; he would not be scared off by evil spirits.

He raised his left hand and beckoned the Heavenly Palace Halberd back to him.

The Heavenly Palace Halberd was pulled out and flew towards Fang Wang.

In that moment, a black hand reached out from the darkness, grabbing the halberd shaft. The black hand was covered in black scales, and its nails were sharp like claws.

Fang Wang frowned, staring intently at the black hand.
