Fang Wang stared at the figure of Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, amidst the demonic winds, immediately noticing that the other possessed only a soul body.

Could it be that the massive skeleton behind the Golden Buddha was the physical body of the Demon Venerable Qi Tian?

Seeing the Demon Venerable Qi Tian, Fo Ling did not care, still staring at Fang Wang with a face whose expression kept changing, clearly extremely disturbed within.

Soon, the Demon Venerable Qi Tian slowly walked out from within the demonic winds, his appearance identical to the previous soul thought, looking aged, only his gaze was brighter and more aggressive.

The gaze of the Demon Venerable Qi Tian fell upon Fang Wang, his lips curving into a wildly arrogant smile, something difficult to associate with his previously humble tone.

“Junior brother, well done. I owe you a favor, and I shall repay it in the future!”

The Demon Venerable Qi Tian spoke proudly, lifting his arms, reveling in the sensation of regaining freedom.

Then, he looked toward Fo Ling, his expression turning fierce as he coldly said, “Old demon, now that my true self has escaped, do you have any last words?”

How could he not harbor resentment after being suppressed for three thousand years?

Fo Ling ignored the Demon Venerable Qi Tian and suddenly knelt toward Fang Wang, clasping his fists and said solemnly, “Greetings to Your Majesty!” Your Majesty?

The Demon Venerable Qi Tian was taken aback for a moment, then looked at Fang Wang with suspicion.

Fang Wang looked at Fo Ling and asked, “I am not your Emperor.”

“You just performed the Jiuyou Zizaishu. Since the Emperor fell, no second person has mastered this art. You must certainly be the reincarnation of the Emperor,” Fo Ling insisted through gritted teeth.

Upon hearing this, the Demon Venerable Qi Tian looked toward Fang Wang with a strange gleam in his eyes, asking, “You know the Jiuyou Zizaishu?”

This art was incredibly profound, he had studied it for a hundred years within the hall and still failed to grasp its essence before being suppressed…

Knowing how difficult the Jiuyou Zizaishu was, the Demon Venerable Qi Tian had assumed that Fang Wang had already mastered this art long ago.

Fang Wang calmly asked, “Is the Ghost Emperor not the Emperor you speak

Fo Ling replied, “The Ghost Emperor is His Majesty’s crown prince, not the Emperor himself. He has been waiting all this time for His Majesty to come here. This entire inheritance site was prepared for Your Majesty. The Ghost Emperor once said that should Your Majesty come here and see the scripture, you would recall your past.”

Fang Wang shook his head, saying, “I am not your Emperor, I simply possess great comprehension.”

After speaking, he then asked, “This so-called Jiuyou inheritance, aside from

the Jiuyou Zizaishu, does it contain other powerful techniques?”

Fo Ling frowned and said, “This golden hall is the complete Jiuyou inheritance, it contains various spells that were all mastered by His Majesty. Besides the

Jiuyou Zizaishu, the strongest are the Vajra Invincible Saint Body and the Great

Celestial Infinite Scripture. With any one of these three, one could traverse the Mortal Realm with ease.”

Fang Wang fell silent.

The Demon Venerable Qi Tian couldn’t help but sneer, “Having one of the three is one thing, refining it is another, especially for the human race.”

He continued, “Junior brother, there’s no need to pursue the Vajra Invincible Saint Body, the Great Celestial Infinite Scripture; it’s a waste of time. You might as well wait to ascend. Although our master has severed the connection with immortality, I know that The Upper Realm will surely repair the path to ascension. When it’s time for you to ascend, there will be superior cultivation techniques waiting for you.”

“Humph, the cultivation techniques of The Upper Realm may not necessarily compare to His Majesty’s ultimate teachings,” Fo Ling disdainfully stated.

The Demon Venerable Qi Tian’s gaze turned cold as he walked toward Fo Ling, snorting, “If the Grand An Divine Dynasty could really compare to the celestial dynasties of The Upper Realm, it wouldn’t have been annihilated!”

These words deeply wounded Fo Ling, but he did not burst into a tirade, only calmly looking at Fang Wang.

Fang Wang spoke, “Senior brother, let it be, this was our initiative after all. If we were to destroy him now, it might only bring greater troubles. Senior brother, having just gained your freedom, you need time to recover your strength.”

No matter what, having received the inheritance of this hall, he owed the Grand An Divine Dynasty a favor. He did not want to destroy this place; perhaps all the lingering souls here were subjects of the Grand An Divine Dynasty.

The Demon Venerable Qi Tian stopped in his tracks, his brow furrowed.

Fang Wang turned back to Fo Ling and asked, “Is there a congenital Vajra

Invincible Saint Body in the world?”

Fo Ling considered and said, “In that era, indeed, there were many Holy

Bodies, Divine Bodies, and Overbearing Bodies, but the Vajra Invincible Saint Body created by His Majesty is absolutely the strongest. His Majesty once said he hoped his descendants could inherit his Vajra Invincible Saint Body from birth, and in doing so, they would certainly surpass him.”

“The strongest physique? What a joke, the most robust bodies can only be found within the Demon Race,” the Demon Venerable Qi Tian disdainfully said.

Fo Ling contemptuously said, “You trivial demon, if it were back in the day, you wouldn’t even qualify to serve as a stepping stone for His Majesty. Your vision determines your achievements. The Jiuyou Zizaishu may be strong, but it is only a method of protection. True strength lies in the Vajra Invincible Saint Body. A fully realized Vajra Invincible Saint Body descends like the radiant sun, surely there are still legends in the Mortal Realm about the sun falling from the sky, burning all the lands. That was not the Sun God descending, but our Emperor coming down from the heavens.”

Fang Wang had indeed heard such legends, but he was not surprised, for no one Imew better than himself the power of the Vajra Invincible Saint Body.

Indeed, this physique had no upper limits, at least in his understanding. After refining it, the longer one lived, the stronger it became. As one’s realm progressed, the advantages of this physique would only grow larger.

“Humph!”

The Demon Venerable Qi Tian snorted coldly, though angered, he was fully aware that he couldn’t compare to the Emperor of the Grand An Divine

Dynasty, especially since he had witnessed the power of the Ghost Emperor.

“I should leave now.”

Fang Wang shook his head and turned, walking toward the entrance of the great hall.

He would practice here again later when he felt better.

He did not want to enter the Heavenly Palace now; he feared he might lose his mind!

Fo Ling kowtowed to Fang Wang, shouting, “Buddha bids farewell to His Majesty, awaiting the day Your Majesty regains the memories of your previous life. Buddha is willing to help His Majesty rebuild the Divine Dynasty!” Fang Wang did not respond.

The Demon Venerable Qi Tian watched Fo Ling, his eyes flickering, hands clenched in his sleeves.

After a moment of struggle, he still opted not to take action.

Fang Wang was right; if he killed Fo Ling now, the Ghost Emperor would surely rage, and endless troubles would follow.

The Demon Venerable Qi Tian turned and followed Fang Wang, departing.

From the golden hall, Fang Wang walked all the way to the outside of the Grand An Resentment Temple. Neither the Grand An Qi Yuan nor those restless spirits dared to approach Fang Wang, not even daring to make the slightest noise.

Fang Wang walked down the mountainside instead of flying.

The rolling sandstorm still surrounded the majestic mountain. His Golden Scale White Feather Robe fluttered in response, and Fang Wang stopped in his tracks, turning around to look up at Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, who was standing on the cliff looking down at him.

“Do you have any further business, Senior Brother?” Fang Wang asked indifferently.

Under the darkness of night, Qi Tian’s eyes flickered with an intimidating chill as he stared at Fang Wang, his expression gradually turning dangerous as he said solemnly, “Junior Brother has mastered the Nine Dragons Divine Transformation Art and gained control over the Jiuyou Zizaishu. You truly make your Senior Brother feel inferior.”

Fang Wang simply continued to look at him intently.

For some reason, Qi Tian felt a sense of unease under Fang Wang’s gaze.

At that moment, Qi Tian could not see through Fang Wang, but he felt that Fang Wang was deliberately waiting for him to make a move.

This intuition was very strong!

Man and demon stood off against each other midway up the mountainside.

In the end, it was Qi Tian who broke the silence. He grinned and said, “Senior Brother will always remember the kindness of Junior Brother. Once I return to the Mortal Realm and rebuild my body, if you ever need anything, you can always come to me.”

Fang Wang’s smile broadened, brimming with confidence, and Qi Tian sensed a trace of scorn.

Before Qi Tian could ponder further, Fang Wang suddenly vanished from the spot.

Qi Tian’s pupils dilated abruptly.

“As expected! He really has learned the Jiuyou Zizaishu…”

Qi Tian felt a shock of awe internally, followed by a surge of envy and jealousy.

Upon regaining his composure, another thought occurred to him.

If Fang Wang had already mastered the Jiuyou Zizaishu, why then did he come in search of it?

Could it be that Fang Wang was truly the reincarnation of the last emperor of the Grand An Divine Dynasty and had come to outwit him on purpose?

Or perhaps…

Qi Tian’s face grew increasingly gloomy, a trace of fear flickering through his eyes.

Fang Wang reappeared midway up the mountainside, still on the same majestic mountain as the Grand An Resentment Temple, only now the world around was brighter.

He had returned to the Mortal Realm.

The realms of Yin and Yang correspond to one another, with many places being identical in both.

Turning around, Fang Wang could see indeed a large temple on the mountain, now in ruins, with only the bases remaining of the two stone statues that had once stood at its entrance.

At this moment, he could sense several trial-takers inside the temple, contesting over something.

Fang Wang soared upwards, flying toward the mountain peak.

Within the Eternal Life Tower.

Suddenly, an image of Fang Wang appeared on a red beam of light, right at the original spot, allowing Xiao Zi, Zhao Zhen, Zhu Yan, and Chu Yin to see Fang Wang without having to move.

“It’s the young master. How did he suddenly appear here?” Xiao Zi exclaimed joyfully.

Zhu Yan stroked his chin and said, “Perhaps he touched some sort of teleportation restriction. Such secret realms are always full of mysteries.”

Zhao Zhen, focusing on Fang Wang, suddenly remarked, “Why do I feel like there’s something off about the master?”

More and more onlookers turned their attention to Fang Wang.

Fang Wang flew straight to the mountaintop and sat facing the wind. He immediately activated the Vajra Invincible Saint Body and began to voraciously absorb nature’s spiritual energy.

Even though he knew many were watching him, Fang Wang showed no concern, ready to transform directly into the Vajra Invincible Saint Body!

He was very curious about the marvelous effects that combining the Vajra Invincible Saint Body with the Heavenly Body might yield.

In an instant, a strong wind arose between heaven and earth, growing more violent by the moment. Spiritual Energy began to surge crazily into Fang Wang’s body, quickly forming a huge whirlwind around him.

Although the Spiritual Energy of Qi Tian’s secret realm was thin, the realm was vast enough. Fang Wang was absorbing not just the Spiritual Energy from the land but also drawing it from beneath the ground.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Thunderclouds gathered suddenly, and it was as if the colors of the sky and the clouds were changing.

Figure after figure flew out from the dilapidated Grand An Resentment Temple, anxious and looking in all directions, wondering if something big had happened.

Soon, their gazes fixed on Fang Wang on the mountaintop.

As Fang Wang began his frenzied absorption of the nature’s spiritual energy, flames ignited on his body. These were not the Solaris True Fire, but a physical manifestation of Yang Energy.

The range of his influence expanded greatly.

A hundred miles!

Five hundred miles!

A thousand miles!

In less than thirty breaths’ time, all the nature’s spiritual energy within Qi Tian’s secret realm was rushing madly towards Fang Wang. The mountain beneath him trembled with the influx, chunks of rock falling off, and the ground itself shaking; even fissures started appearing at the base of the mountain..
