The Heavenly Palace Halberd quivered violently in the black hand, struggling to break free. Under Fang Wang’s gaze, a figure slowly floated out from the darkness.

It was a soul spirit with only an upper body, the lower half like smoke, the upper half that of a man, his body covered with black scales, even his face. Pale eyes housed golden pupils, and two horns protruded from his forehead, his long hair drifting slightly as he regarded Fang Wang with a cold glance.

Behind him, one figure after another continuously drifted out of the darkness, like him, with only upper bodies, both male and female, a total of seven, all exuding a terrifying murderous aura.

Fang Wang stood outside the Grand An Resentment Temple, watching the seven dreadful soul spirits from afar, when suddenly his eyes sharpened, and that horned soul spirit felt an unimaginable force erupt; his soul body jerked forward, causing his right hand to loosen.

Snap!

Fang Wang’s left hand caught the Heavenly Palace Halberd, he swung the halberd to dissipate the force, then took a step forward, slightly raising his chin, and looked down on the seven soul spirits inside the temple as he asked, “Hey, who are you, and who is imprisoned in this temple?”

The pupils of the horned soul spirit dilated, his right hand trembling. He looked at his own right hand, then at Fang Wang, a trace of fear flashing in his eyes.

The other six soul spirits were also taken aback, fully aware of the strength of the horned soul spirit, all intimidated by Fang Wang for a moment, not daring to make any more noise.

“You may call us Grand An Qi Yuan, people of the Mortal Realm. I advise you to turn back and not to enter this temple. It imprisons those who have offended the celestial authority of the Grand An Divine Dynasty. If you persist in breaking in, be wary of everlasting damnation.”

A female soul spirit with a relatively gentle appearance spoke with a heavy tone.

Another female soul spirit looked at Fang Wang with envious eyes and coldly said, “Why bother persuading him? If he dares to step inside, we’ll tear him apart!”

The other five male soul spirits stared fixedly at Fang Wang, their expressions varied, with anger, hatred, surprise, greed, and fear.

This made Fang Wang hesitate; he couldn’t even be sure about the origins of that mysterious voice, much less wantonly offend an unknown enemy.

After thinking it over, Fang Wang said, “Actually, I came looking for the Nine Serenities inheritance. As soon as I entered the Netherworld, I was drawn here by a voice, which said it was not going to last much longer. I don’t know him; if you know where the Nine Serenities inheritance is, I might not need to force my way into your esteemed temple.”

Nine Serenities inheritance?

All of the Grand An Qi Yuan furrowed their brows, a tall soul spirit among them said, “We have not heard of any Nine Serenities inheritance. Since you were misled here, then leave. This is not your place to be.”

Fang Wang frowned.

He was pondering whether to take the risk.

Reason told him it wasn’t necessary. Without the Nine Serenities inheritance, he still had other paths to travel—opportunities were endless in the world.

But he couldn’t forget Zhou Xue’s evaluation of Jiu You True Person; the Nine Serenities inheritance had made the True Person into one unbound by The Upper Realm.

After pondering for a while, Fang Wang decided to leave.

There was no need to force his way through. If he were to die here, it’s he could pray that Zhou Xue would be reborn again.

Just as Fang Wang turned around, that same mysterious voice rang in his ears again:

“The Nine Serenities inheritance…is inside the temple…l am Qi Tian, the

Demon Venerable… If you rescue me, I surely will repay you…”

Fang Wang paused in his steps, causing the Grand An Qi Yuan to frown again.

Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable?

Fang Wang’s expression turned odd.

The historically mysteriously vanished Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, imprisoned in the Netherworld?

If indeed true, no wonder his whereabouts had been undetectable.

Fang Wang glanced at the Grand An Qi Yuan, on high alert, and still chose not to believe it.

He turned around and headed down the mountain.

Seeing this, the Grand An Qi Yuan all breathed a sigh of relief.

“Wait…”

“The Nine Serenities inheritance is the Divine Skill inheritance of the Grand An

Divine Dynasty, hidden behind the statue in the Grand An Resentment Temple. If mastered, one can move freely between the Three Realms, and even after ascension, not be bound by the celestial laws of The Upper Realm, freely traveling between The Upper Realm and the Mortal Realm. This is an unimaginable Divine Skill that all Great Saints throughout history have been pursuing. ”

The voice of Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, came again, this time more urgent, no longer as weak.

Upon hearing this, Fang Wang turned to look back at the Grand An Resentment Temple, his glance once again lifting the hearts of the Grand An Qi Yuan.

Fang Wang was still hesitating.

Divine Skills that all Great Saints pursued, were they so easily obtained?

Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, seemed to have grasped the doubts in Fang Wang’s mind, transmitting again, “The Grand An Ghost Emperor has gone to pursue enlightenment and will not return for at least fifty years. I had chosen an heir to rescue me during this opportunity, but alas, you killed him.” Jiu You True Person?

Fang Wang immediately asked, “How did you, in the Netherworld, establish contact with the Jiu You True Person?”

Upon this utterance, the Grand An Qi Yuan’s expressions changed dramatically, instantly realizing someone was persuading Fang Wang.

“Third brother, go check on him!”

The horned soul spirit commanded in a deep tone, and immediately one soul spirit turned and vanished into the darkness, while the other six Qi Yuan kept their gaze fixed on Fang Wang.

The voice of Qi Tian, the Demon Venerable, swiftly reached Fang Wang, “When I descended to the Netherworld, I feared something might happen, so I left many inheritances in the Mortal Realm. The reason that boy took the name Jiu You was because he obtained my inheritance. As a youth fishing by the sea, he found a piece of my Jade Slip in the belly of a fish, containing a strand of my soul; it was my soul that taught him cultivation. In his storage bag, you will find this Jade Slip.”

Hearing this, Fang Wang’s divine consciousness probed into his storage bag at his waist, forcibly breaking through the prohibitions.

The wealth of Jiu You True Person was truly vast, his storage bag filled with an immense amount of Heavenly Materials and Earthly Treasures, Spirit Stones, Elixirs, with space enough for a mountain.

Fang Wang’s divine consciousness was sharp, and quickly found that Jade Slip, taking it out.

A soul fluctuation emanated from the jade slip, and an apparition emerged. It was an old man, donning a great robe, his back hunched, with two beast ears poking out from his gray hair.

The Grand An Qi Yuan’s faces underwent a drastic change, all thrown into panic.

“How did he come out?”

“No, it’s not the true soul, just a soul thought.”

“Indeed, it’s that guy playing tricks, his thieving heart never dies!”

“I don’t know why His Majesty didn’t just kill him, wouldn’t that be better?”

“Damn it, what do we do now? Is that person from the Mortal Realm really going to force his way in?”

Fang Wang ignored the alarmed discussion of the Grand An Qi Yuan, his gaze fixed on the soul thought of the Qi Tian Demon Venerable.

Qi Tian Demon Venerable’s face was expressionless. He looked up at the plaque of the Grand An Resentment Temple and then at Fang Wang. With a sigh, he said ethereally, “Disciple, I’ve calculated a thousand possibilities, but I did not foresee your fall before even entering the Netherworld… it’s over…” His tone was filled with regret and pity. He looked deeply at Fang Wang, then vanished like smoke in the wind.

Fang Wang raised an eyebrow. It seemed the Jiu You True Person was indeed Qi Tian Demon Venerable’s disciple and had established a deep connection with his soul thought.

Qi Tian Demon Venerable desperately hoped for Fang Wang to come to harm. If he were in control of his soul thought, he would not have expressed such sentiments, which also suggested that Qi Tian Demon Venerable had been separated from his own soul thought for too long.

“You being able to kill Jiu You is proof of your qualification to enter this temple. I would not risk it lightly; had Jiu You lacked the strength, I wouldn’t have let him scare the snakes. If he had failed, upon the Ghost Emperor’s return, I would suffer even worse torment…”

Qi Tian Demon Venerable’s voice came again, this time with a plea entwined within the tone.

Hearing this, Fang Wang found it reasonable.

Let’s give it a try!

From the panicked expressions of the Grand An Qi Yuan, he knew they were afraid of him, and fear meant they had no strength to rely on inside the temple!

Fang Wang immediately walked toward the Grand An Resentment Temple, a move that shocked the Grand An Qi Yuan into a state of high alert.

After three steps, Fang Wang charged into the temple.

The Golden Scale White Feather Robe fluttered wildly as Fang Wang, like a wolf among sheep, alarmed the Grand An Qi Yuan into action. In an instant, Fang Wang transformed into a Black Dragon, forcefully scattering the Grand An Qi Yuan, rampaging headlong into the depths of the darkness.

“Nine Dragons Divine Transformation Art!”

The voice of Qi Tian Demon Venerable came, tinged with surprise and delight.

“Young brother, I am a disciple of the Descending Dragon Great Saint. You have received this legacy; we are practically from the same school! ”

Hearing his obsequiousness, Fang Wang remained indifferent.

The Black Dragon roared, colliding and dispersing countless spirits that plunged from the darkness. Soon, a golden light appeared ahead.

Fang Wang broke into a vast, resplendent hall, and there he stopped. The Black Dragon dissipated, revealing his figure.

In the grand hall before him stood a hundred-zhang-tall Golden Buddha, seated on a golden lotus, with his left hand raised to his chest. It was unclear which Buddha it was, but it was a majestic pose.

Fang Wang turned to look behind him; outside the hall, darkness enveloped, spirits surged, and he could even see the figures of the Grand An Qi Yuan, but they dared not enter the hall and could only gaze at Fang Wang with resentment.

“Strange, even if they don’t dare to come in, why aren’t they cursing me?”

Fang Wang thought to himself. He turned his head back to the Golden Buddha, his eyes landing on its face.

In an instant, he felt dizzy and swiftly shifted his gaze away, clearing his mind immediately afterward.

Don’t look at the face of the Golden Buddha!

Fang Wang was alarmed. He hadn’t managed to see what the Golden Buddha really looked like.

“The Jiu You legacy is behind the Golden Buddha, but be careful, there’s a Buddha spirit present,” warned the voice of Qi Tian Demon Venerable.

Fang Wang cursed inwardly. Why hadn’t he mentioned this before?

His impression of this senior plummeted.

However, having come this far, he did indeed want to see what was hidden behind the Golden Buddha.

Fang Wang moved forward. Inside the hall stood huge redwood columns, each with a glimmer of golden light that occasionally became visible. Upon closer inspection, he realized they were inscribed with scriptures.

Suddenly, an idea struck him.

Could it be that these redwood columns bore inscriptions of cultivation techniques?

He no longer hurried to the back of the Golden Buddha and instead focused on one of the redwood columns nearby, committing the continuously emerging scriptures to memory.

“Those are Buddhist teachings on the column. I once tried to understand them, and indeed they contain methods of cultivation, but they are too profound. Don’t waste your time,” said the voice of Qi Tian Demon Venerable. Fang Wang paid it no heed.

He scrutinized the scriptures on the column, sorting out their sequence for reading.

He remembered it all after only one glance.

But he didn’t immediately move on to the Heavenly Palace; he felt the sequence in his memory might be wrong and continued to adjust it.

After the time it took for an incense stick to burn, Fang Wang suddenly felt the world spinning.
