2. Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC ) :

   - various models : `Waterfall, Agile, V-Model, Spiral Model, Rapid Application Development`
   - phases : `Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, , Maintenance & Support`

   1. Waterfall SDLC Model :

   - phases `Requirements, Analysis, Design, implementation, Testing , Delivery ,Maintenance`
   - figure
   - limitations : `inflexibility to changes , no adaptability to changes `

   2. V-model of software development

   - `Verification` and `Validation`
   - Verification: ` User Requirements , System Specifications , Architecture Design  , Module Design , Implementation`
   - Validation: `Unit Testing , Component Testing , Integration Testing, System Testing , User Acceptance Testing`
   - figure
   - limitations : `inflexibility to changes , no adaptability to changes `

   3. Rapid Application Development
   4. Spiral SDLC Model
   5. Agile SDLC methodology
